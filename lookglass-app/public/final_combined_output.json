            "body": "The impact of young voters on the election will become clear after polling day on May 3.\n\nThey're disillusioned, resentful and many suspect the system is rigged against them.\n\nFor the first time, Gen Z and millennial voters outnumber baby boomers at the federal election -- and most of them aren't reaching the same milestones as their parents.\n\nMore than 7 million Australians have already cast their vote ahead of Saturday, and despite a campaign largely shaped by the rising cost of living and housing, it's unclear whether young voters feel satisfied by what's on offer.\n\nPolitical analysts say their grievances could deliver unexpected results in marginal seats.\n\nA widening wealth gap\n\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor in politics at Monash University, said generational inequality could be driving \"unpredictable\" voting patterns among Gen Zs and millennials.\n\n\"They're not reaching the sort of milestones that previous generations did, such as home ownership, marrying [and] having children,\" Dr Strangio said.\n\n\"Those things used to predispose people to becoming more conservative in their outlook.\"\n\nAustralia's birth rate recently hit an all-time low, and government data shows today's 30-34 year-olds are the first age group in more than 47 years where most people don't own a house.\n\nUNSW economics professor Richard Holden said while many young voters earn higher incomes today than their parents did at their age, it was now much harder to build wealth through property ownership.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's rising intergenerational income inequality, but there's a good case to worry about wealth inequality,\" he said.\n\n\"And I'd say that aspect is getting worse.\"\n\nTim Harcourt, an economist at the University of Technology Sydney, agreed the wealth disparity between generations was becoming increasingly acute.\n\n\"It's really starting to bite now as the Baby Boomers retire into their defined benefits superannuation schemes and extra properties,\" he said.\n\n\"I think housing is a red button issue ... and that's where the youth reaction will be really important.\"\n\nYoung voters 'a ticking time bomb'\n\nDr Strangio said voters typically became more conservative as they grew older, but now they're skewing further to the left and feeling increasingly dissatisfied with the major parties.\n\n\"Young voters are a ticking time bomb,\" he said.\n\n\"They're facing real wage declines, high costs for education, difficulty in getting into the housing market and yet so far I think they've been quiet tolerant.\"\n\nBut he warned their patience wouldn't last forever.\n\n\"When we look overseas to places like Trump's America, young men are being attracted to aggressive, populist policies because of inequalities,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's a warning that we do need to address those things with some urgency because we don't want to see those sorts of trends.\"\n\nProfessor Harcourt said while the youth vote typically skewed to the left in inner-city electorates, voting patterns would be harder to predict among tradies or factory workers in rural areas.\n\n\"It's quite unpredictable in the outer suburbs where there's housing stress and population stress, where there is a view that the infrastructure is not keeping up with the population growth,\" he said.\n\nClimate change remains a concern\n\nAside from housing affordability and the cost of living, a new YouGov poll suggests young voters remain deeply concerned about the impacts of climate change.\n\nEarlier this year, Australians' social media accounts lit up with videos of wildfires ripping through Los Angeles and damage from Tropical Cyclone Alfred in parts of Queensland and New South Wales.\n\nAccording to the YouGov poll, four-in-five young voters said climate change would influence their vote in the federal election.\n\nThe poll of 1,622 adult Australian voters, commissioned by Solutions for Climate Australia, found 79 per cent of Gen Zs and 73 per cent of millennials said climate change was an important part of their decision-making at the polling booth.\n\nAbout 67 per cent of undecided voters also said climate change was important in determining their vote.\n\nAustralian Youth Climate Coalition national director Grace Vegesana said the issue wasn't going away.\n\n\"Young people under 40 do deeply care about the climate crisis and if they're not seeing solutions ... they will vote accordingly.\"\n\nShe said many young voters reported feeling left behind this election.\n\n\"We are going to see a shift away from the major parties as people realise [we] want to see ambition, and not just be handed baseline policies that continue business as usual,\" she said.",

            "title": "Your guide to major parties' key policies",
            "body": "Australians across the nation are set to head to the polling booths to decide who will lead the nation for the next three years.\n\nThroughout a rapid election campaign period, the parties have revealed (and sometimes rolled back) their policies on key issues such as health, the cost of living, housing, energy, defence, migration, crime and Indigenous affairs.\n\nTo help you decide who gets your vote, we've compiled a quick guide outlining the major policies on key issues from Labor, the Coalition and the Greens.\n\nHealth\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Albanese government's flagship campaign promise was $8.5bn to deliver an additional 18 million bulk-billed GP visits each year if re-elected. The Labor government also pledged a cap of $25 per prescription for medicines covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Both of these policies were matched by the Coalition. The Coalition will also match Labor's $575m plan to add oral contraceptives, menopause hormone therapies, endometriosis and IVF drugs to the PBS.\n\nLabor: In addition to the above policies, Labor pledged a $1bn boost for headspace clinics and specialist centres for youth, $644m for 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, and $16.7m to bolster mental health support services for new parents.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has promised a $5m review of women-specific items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS, $500m to raise Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20, $400m for youth mental health and a $15m boost to the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund.\n\nGreens: The Greens also support an expansion of Medicare but at a far greater level. They have pledged $195bn to Medicare to expand the system to include dental and extended mental health support.\n\nCost of living\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Coalition has backed Labor's position to freeze the alcohol excise on draught beer for two years, starting from August 1, 2025. Both parties have also agreed to extend energy bill rebates for all households until the end of 2025, saving $150 per household at a cost of $1.8bn.\n\nLabor: Effective from June 1, 2025, the Labor government will implement a 20 per cent reduction on all student loan debts, including HELP, VET Student Loans and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans. A re-elected Labor government would introduce an instant $1000 tax deduction for work-related expenses, and tax breaks announced during the federal budget for those in the lowest bracket would be made permanent.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged a one-time tax offset of up to $1200 for workers earning up to $144,000. If elected, the Coalition would cut the fuel excise in half for 12 months starting in July, but it would repeal the changes that give people in the lowest bracket a tax break.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to make all public transport cost 50c, wipe all student debt and provide universal mental health care with unlimited sessions.\n\nHousing\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both have promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from buying existing homes for two years and have ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\nLabor: Labor will expand its Homes for Australia plan to build an extra 100,000 homes specifically for first-time buyers, and all first-home buyers will be eligible for 5 per cent deposits.\n\nCoalition: TheCoalition will allow first-home buyers to take 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to $50,000, for a home deposit. First-home buyers of new properties will be able to claim the interest paid on the first $650,000 of a mortgage as a tax deduction. The Coalition has also vowed to maintain the Home Guarantee Scheme program, which includes a 5 per cent deposit program for first-homebuyers, and a 2 per cent deposit scheme for single parents or eligible single legal guardians with at least one dependent.\n\nGreens: The Greens will phase out tax handouts for property investors with more than one investment property by scrapping the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. They also pledge to limit rent increases to 2 per cent every two years.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both Labor and the Coalition have committed to a $10m investment in a new Bureau of Meteorology weather radar for regional Queensland.\n\nLabor: Labor will slash the cost of solar battery installations by up to $4000 per household from July 1 and extend the energy bill rebate until the end of the year, saving households $150. Labor will also aim to source 82 per cent of the electricity grid from renewables by 2030.\n\nCoalition: One of the Liberal Party's flagship policies is its nuclear plan. A Coalition government will build seven government-owned nuclear reactors co-located alongside retiring coal-fired generators by 2050, with the first two smaller generators in operation by 2035. Under a Coalition government, the energy mix will be 54 per cent renewables, 33 per cent nuclear, with the remaining 13 per cent battery storage and gas.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to block all new coal and gas projects. The Greens' climate and energy plan includes expanding the Net Zero Economy Authority to support all fossil fuel workers and invest $10bn in clean industries and infrastructure in transitioning regions.\n\nDefence\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have pledged to regain ownership of the Port of Darwin.\n\nLabor: Labor has pledged at least $50.3bn into defence over the next decade, with Anthony Albanese leaving the door open to further increases. An additional $262m has been allocated to bolster local defence industries and develop Australia's nuclear-powered submarine supply chain under the AUKUS partnership.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition's flagship defence policy is a $21bn boost to the defence budget over the next five years, pushing total military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The Coalition has pledged to speed up the AUKUS submarine agreement, though it has not detailed how.\n\nThe Greens: The Greens have pledged to withdraw from the AUKUS political pact and renegotiate Australia's position in the ANZUS treaty. As a result, the Greens would attempt to stop the $375bn purchase of AUKUS nuclear submarines.\n\nMigration\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have announced they will increase the cost of student visa applications. The Coalition pledged to triple the cost of student visa applications to $5000 (up from $1600), while a re-elected Labor government would increase the cost of student visa applications to $2000.\n\nLabor: Labor has been relatively silent on the issue of migration but canned the Coalition's policies as \"savage\".\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged to reduce the permanent migration intake by 25 per cent. The cuts would target those on skilled visas in an effort to lower permanent migration from 185,000 in 2024-25 to 140,000 in 2025-26. Mr Dutton has also said the party would slash the number of international students by 80,000. The Coalition has also made a commitment to reduce the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.\n\nGreens: The Greens want to expand Australia's humanitarian intake to 50,000 places per year and create additional places via a new private humanitarian sponsorship program.\n\nCrime\n\nLabor: Labor has promised $157m over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco and $8.6m \u00ef\"\u00bfin funding for management of domestic violence perpetrators. It has pledged to take steps to prevent domestic violence perpetrators from using the tax and corporate systems to create debts as a form of coercive control.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition announced a $750m package to tackle crime across the nation. Dubbed \"Operation Safer Communities\", the Opposition Leader's plan would implement a national drug strike team and a 12-month pilot of a National Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme. The Coalition has also pledged $90m to tackle domestic violence, including implementing a National Domestic Violence Register to ensure police and relevant agencies can share information about violent offenders.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to fund the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children with $12n over 12 years. They have also earmarked $3.3m for a national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to help people who may be at risk of domestic violence to find out if their current or former partner has a history of violent criminal offences.\n\nIndigenous affairs\n\nLabor: Labor has broadly committed to a continuation of efforts to close the gap. It has promised an extra $5mn towards pre-existing plans for a TAFE Centre of Excellence with hubs in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and $77m towards sea wall and wastewater infrastructure in the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has vowed to establish a royal commission into allegations of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities and reintroduce compulsory income management via the Cashless Debit Card.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged $250 to establish a National Truth and Justice Commission to acknowledge and document historic and ongoing injustices. They will also introduce a federal Act to protect First Nations cultural heritage.",

            "title": "Dozens of homeless people living in national forest evicted by US Forest Service",
            "body": "Service closing area in Oregon for wildfire prevention plan months after Trump order to increase timber production\n\nDozens of homeless people who have been living in a national forest in central Oregon for years were being evicted on Thursday by the US Forest Service, as it closed the area for a wildfire prevention project that will involve removing smaller trees, clearing debris and setting controlled burns over thousands of acres.\n\nThe project has been on the books for years, and the decision to remove the encampment in the Deschutes national forest comes two months after the Trump administration issued an executive order directing federal agencies to increase timber production and forest management projects aimed at reducing wildfire risk. It wasn't immediately clear if the evictions were a result of that order, but homeless advocates seized on the timing on Thursday, as US Forest Service officers blocked the access road.\n\n\"The fact that they are doing this with such vigor shortly after they announced that the forests would be opened up for logging I don't think is a coincidence,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture, which oversees the US Forest Service, and the service's Pacific Northwest Region did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\n\"The closure does not target any specific user group and will restrict all access, including day use and overnight camping, while crews operate heavy machinery, conduct prescribed burns, and clean up hazardous materials,\" Deschutes national forest spokesperson Kaitlyn Webb said in an email. \"It's not safe for the public to be in the area while heavy machinery is operating, trees are being felled, mowing operations are active, and prescribed burning is occurring.\"\n\nCampers who had set up trailers, recreational vehicles and tents amidst the ponderosa pines in the Deschutes national forest scrambled in the darkness Wednesday night to pack up and get their engines working again. Authorities closed the two-lane road in the early hours of Thursday morning, and it was not immediately clear how many people were left in the forest by the afternoon, though some were unable to leave.\n\nThe US Forest Service has been working for years on plans to close part of the Deschutes national forest near Bend for forest restoration and wildfire mitigation. But the number of people living in that part of the forest has grown, with many losing homes during the coronavirus pandemic due to job losses and high housing costs, Rabinowitz said.\n\nDonald Trump's administration has acted to roll back environmental safeguards around future logging projects on more than half of US national forests, under an emergency designation that cites dangers from wildfires.\n\nWhether the administration's move will boost lumber supplies as Trump envisioned in an executive order he signed in March remains to be seen. Joe Biden's administration also sought more logging in public forests to combat fires, which have become more intense amid drier and hotter conditions linked to the climate crisis, yet US Forest Service timber sales stayed relatively flat under his tenure.\n\nThe Cabin Butte Vegetation Management Project, a wildfire mitigation treatment on some 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares), is prompting the closures in the Deschutes national forest.\n\nThe goal of the work is to reduce wildfire risk and restore damaged habitats where development encroaches on natural areas near Bend, Deschutes national forest officials said in a statement. Recreation sites and trails in that area will be closed through April next year.\n\nMultiple US Forest Service officials and vehicles were stationed at the Deschutes national forest road closure on Thursday. A sign on the metal gate blocking the road said the temporary emergency closure will last at least one year.\n\nViolators could face up six months in jail, fines up to $5,000, or both.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mandy Bryant, who said she had lived in the encampment for about three years, was cleaning up her site and trying to get a trailer to start so she could move it.\n\n\"You could feel the heaviness in the air and just the stress and depression that people are feeling,\" she told the Associated Press. \"We're up there on the list of groups of people that society doesn't really care for.\"\n\nFour people living in the encampment including Bryant, along with two homeless advocates, filed for a restraining order to stop the closure earlier this month. The claim argued it would cause irreparable harm to more than 100 people who were living there, many of whom have disabilities.\n\nThe government responded in court filings that US Forest Service staff in January began notifying homeless people living in the area of the upcoming closure. Original plans for the project were published in 2019 and were authorized by the US Forest Service in 2023, the court filings said.\n\nUS district court judge Michael McShane denied the restraining order on Tuesday and issued a written opinion on Thursday.\n\n\"The public's significant interest in restoring natural habitats, preventing catastrophic wildfires, and preserving the overall health of Deschutes National Forest is not outweighed by the interest of 150 or so individuals in residing on this particular plot of land,\" he wrote in his ruling.\n\nWebb, a Deschutes national forest spokesperson, told the Oregonian/OregonLive that the government's goal is \"voluntary compliance\", but Forest Service officers and staff will patrol and \"enforce the closure and ensure public safety\".",

            "body": "Where Labor, Coalition and Greens stand on key issuesGeorgie Kibel, Blair Jackson, Jessica WangNewsWireFri, 2 May 2025 7:02AM\n\nAustralians across the nation are set to head to the polling booths to decide who will lead the nation for the next three years.\n\nThroughout a rapid election campaign period, the parties have revealed (and sometimes rolled back) their policies on key issues such as health, the cost of living, housing, energy, defence, migration, crime and Indigenous affairs.\n\nTo help you decide who gets your vote, we've compiled a quick guide outlining the major policies on key issues from Labor, the Coalition and the Greens.\n\nHealth\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Albanese government's flagship campaign promise was $8.5bn to deliver an additional 18 million bulk-billed GP visits each year if re-elected. The Labor government also pledged a cap of $25 per prescription for medicines covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Both of these policies were matched by the Coalition. The Coalition will also match Labor's $575m plan to add oral contraceptives, menopause hormone therapies, endometriosis and IVF drugs to the PBS.\n\nFeel like giving the politicians a rating this Federal election?\n\nOur Pollie Rater lets you do just that.\n\nRate the politicians\n\nLabor: In addition to the above policies, Labor pledged a $1bn boost for headspace clinics and specialist centres for youth, $644m for 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, and $16.7m to bolster mental health support services for new parents.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has promised a $5m review of women-specific items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS, $500m to raise Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20, $400m for youth mental health and a $15m boost to the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund.\n\nGreens: The Greens also support an expansion of Medicare but at a far greater level. They have pledged $195bn to Medicare to expand the system to include dental and extended mental health support.\n\nCost of living\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Coalition has backed Labor's position to freeze the alcohol excise on draught beer for two years, starting from August 1, 2025. Both parties have also agreed to extend energy bill rebates for all households until the end of 2025, saving $150 per household at a cost of $1.8bn.\n\nLabor: Effective from June 1, 2025, the Labor government will implement a 20 per cent reduction on all student loan debts, including HELP, VET Student Loans and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans. A re-elected Labor government would introduce an instant $1000 tax deduction for work-related expenses, and tax breaks announced during the federal budget for those in the lowest bracket would be made permanent.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged a one-time tax offset of up to $1200 for workers earning up to $144,000. If elected, the Coalition would cut the fuel excise in half for 12 months starting in July, but it would repeal the changes that give people in the lowest bracket a tax break.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to make all public transport cost 50c, wipe all student debt and provide universal mental health care with unlimited sessions.\n\nHousing\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both have promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from buying existing homes for two years and have ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\nLabor: Labor will expand its Homes for Australia plan to build an extra 100,000 homes specifically for first-time buyers, and all first-home buyers will be eligible for 5 per cent deposits.\n\nCoalition: TheCoalition will allow first-home buyers to take 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to $50,000, for a home deposit. First-home buyers of new properties will be able to claim the interest paid on the first $650,000 of a mortgage as a tax deduction. The Coalition has also vowed to maintain the Home Guarantee Scheme program, which includes a 5 per cent deposit program for first-homebuyers, and a 2 per cent deposit scheme for single parents or eligible single legal guardians with at least one dependent.\n\nGreens: The Greens will phase out tax handouts for property investors with more than one investment property by scrapping the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. They also pledge to limit rent increases to 2 per cent every two years.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both Labor and the Coalition have committed to a $10m investment in a new Bureau of Meteorology weather radar for regional Queensland.\n\nLabor: Labor will slash the cost of solar battery installations by up to $4000 per household from July 1 and extend the energy bill rebate until the end of the year, saving households $150. Labor will also aim to source 82 per cent of the electricity grid from renewables by 2030.\n\nCoalition: One of the Liberal Party's flagship policies is its nuclear plan. A Coalition government will build seven government-owned nuclear reactors co-located alongside retiring coal-fired generators by 2050, with the first two smaller generators in operation by 2035. Under a Coalition government, the energy mix will be 54 per cent renewables, 33 per cent nuclear, with the remaining 13 per cent battery storage and gas.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to block all new coal and gas projects. The Greens' climate and energy plan includes expanding the Net Zero Economy Authority to support all fossil fuel workers and invest $10bn in clean industries and infrastructure in transitioning regions.\n\nDefence\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have pledged to regain ownership of the Port of Darwin.\n\nLabor: Labor has pledged at least $50.3bn into defence over the next decade, with Anthony Albanese leaving the door open to further increases. An additional $262m has been allocated to bolster local defence industries and develop Australia's nuclear-powered submarine supply chain under the AUKUS partnership.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition's flagship defence policy is a $21bn boost to the defence budget over the next five years, pushing total military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The Coalition has pledged to speed up the AUKUS submarine agreement, though it has not detailed how.\n\nThe Greens: The Greens have pledged to withdraw from the AUKUS political pact and renegotiate Australia's position in the ANZUS treaty. As a result, the Greens would attempt to stop the $375bn purchase of AUKUS nuclear submarines.\n\nMigration\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have announced they will increase the cost of student visa applications. The Coalition pledged to triple the cost of student visa applications to $5000 (up from $1600), while a re-elected Labor government would increase the cost of student visa applications to $2000.\n\nLabor: Labor has been relatively silent on the issue of migration but canned the Coalition's policies as \"savage\".\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged to reduce the permanent migration intake by 25 per cent. The cuts would target those on skilled visas in an effort to lower permanent migration from 185,000 in 2024-25 to 140,000 in 2025-26. Mr Dutton has also said the party would slash the number of international students by 80,000. The Coalition has also made a commitment to reduce the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.\n\nGreens: The Greens want to expand Australia's humanitarian intake to 50,000 places per year and create additional places via a new private humanitarian sponsorship program.\n\nCrime\n\nLabor: Labor has promised $157m over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco and $8.6m in funding for management of domestic violence perpetrators. It has pledged to take steps to prevent domestic violence perpetrators from using the tax and corporate systems to create debts as a form of coercive control.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition announced a $750m package to tackle crime across the nation. Dubbed \"Operation Safer Communities\", the Opposition Leader's plan would implement a national drug strike team and a 12-month pilot of a National Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme. The Coalition has also pledged $90m to tackle domestic violence, including implementing a National Domestic Violence Register to ensure police and relevant agencies can share information about violent offenders.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to fund the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children with $12n over 12 years. They have also earmarked $3.3m for a national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to help people who may be at risk of domestic violence to find out if their current or former partner has a history of violent criminal offences.\n\nIndigenous affairs\n\nLabor: Labor has broadly committed to a continuation of efforts to close the gap. It has promised an extra $5mn towards pre-existing plans for a TAFE Centre of Excellence with hubs in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and $77m towards sea wall and wastewater infrastructure in the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has vowed to establish a royal commission into allegations of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities and reintroduce compulsory income management via the Cashless Debit Card.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged $250 to establish a National Truth and Justice Commission to acknowledge and document historic and ongoing injustices. They will also introduce a federal Act to protect First Nations cultural heritage.\n\nOriginally published as Where Labor, Coalition and Greens stand on key issues\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

            "title": "South Korean Presidential Frontrunner Potentially Disqualified by Court Ruling",
            "body": "Lee Jae-myung, the front-running candidate in South Korea's special presidential election, may have been disqualified by a ruling from the Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nLee, the leader of the left-wing Democratic Party of Korea (DP), has been leading in the polls ever since President Yoon Suk-yeol of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) was impeached in December. Yoon was impeached for declaring martial law in December, ostensibly to combat \"subversive anti-state elements.\"\n\nSouth Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed Yoon from office on April 4, paving the way for a special election to replace him on June 3. The interim president who managed the office for most of the time since Yoon's impeachment, Han Duck-soo, resigned his position on Thursday and is expected to enter the race as a candidate.\n\n\"I have two paths ahead of me. One is completing the heavy responsibility that I handle now. The other is putting down that responsibility and taking a heavier responsibility. I've finally determined to put down my post to do what I can and what I have to help overcome the crises facing us,\" Han said on Thursday, strongly suggesting he has an eye on the upcoming election.\n\nHan's resignation would have bumped Minister of Economy and Finance Choi Sang-mok into the acting presidential hot seat -- except the opposition immediately filed a motion to impeach Choi, and he resigned from his office within a matter of hours.\n\nPPP lawmakers stormed out of the assembly hall to protest the impeachment vote against Choi, who has already been acting president once before, when the opposition impeached Han Duck-soo in December. The Supreme Court overturned that impeachment and reinstalled Han as the acting president in March.\n\nLee Jae-myung, who ran for president in 2022 and narrowly lost to Yoon, announced his intention to run again on April 10. He said income inequality and economic growth would be his top priorities.\n\n\"Our economy is in dire straits. The government's role is important, but for the past three years, the government has neglected the economy,\" he said when declaring his candidacy.\n\nThe DP formally nominated Lee as its candidate on Tuesday, giving him almost 90% of its votes. According to the most recent polls he is running far ahead of potential challenges with 38% support from the public. No other candidate is polling above 10% at the moment, although the conservative vote may coalesce around a single candidate when the PPP nominates its candidate next weekend.\n\n\"Now, the people and our party colleagues gave me an opportunity to win back the presidency and build a new, real Republic of Korea. Thank you! I'll humbly uphold that ardent,\" Lee said in his acceptance speech.\n\nUnfortunately for Lee, the Supreme Court might have bounced him out of the race on Thursday by overturning a previous ruling that cleared him of charges that he made \"false statements\" during his 2022 race against Yoon.\n\nLee is under investigation for several charges that would seem fairly serious, including corruption allegations linked to a real-estate scandal from his days as governor of Gyeonggi province, but the election law case was always seen as the one that might sink him, because he has already been found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison for it.\n\nLee was accused of making false statements on two occasions in 2021. In the first instance, he claimed he was coerced by the national Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport into rezoning some property to benefit a major development project while he was mayor of the city of Seongnam.\n\nLee's critics believe he made the controversial rezoning decision for his own personal financial benefit. The Land Ministry said Lee's story of coercion was false, and the ministry's position would ultimately be accepted by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe other allegedly false statement was made in December 2021, when Lee denied his links to the massive Seongnam real estate scandal. The court found Lee's denials were demonstrably false and intended to manipulate voters.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court found Lee guilty on both charges of making false statements in November 2024 and sentenced him to a year in prison. The sentence was suspended, but under South Korean law, the verdict was enough to disqualify him from running for office for at least five years.\n\nThe Seoul High Court overturned the Central District Court's ruling in March, clearing the way for Lee to run in the June presidential election. Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court, and on Thursday they won their case, as the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's ruling.\n\nChief Justice Jo Hee-de said on Thursday that Lee's statements in October and December 2021 were \"judged to be false statements on matters important enough to ruin voters' accurate judgement on the defendant's eligibility for public office.\"\n\nLee might have one more chance to stay in the race, as the Supreme Court tossed his case back down to the appellate court level for a new ruling. The Supreme Court moved very quickly to hear Lee's case, but the appeals court could take months before issuing a new ruling.\n\nIronically, the four serious corruption cases against Lee -- the very charges he was convicted of making false statements about in 2021 -- probably will not reach the courts until long after the June election, so they are not seen as serious impediments to his run.\n\nThere was a good deal of confusion among politicians, commentators, and legal experts in South Korea on Thursday over whether Lee can continue running for president after the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nPolitical consultant Park Sung-min told Nikkei Asia on Thursday that Lee can legally continue his campaign, and he probably will, but he probably shouldn't. If the appeals court moves as quickly as the Supreme Court did, a ruling could be dropped right in the middle of the campaign that forces Lee to suspend his candidacy.\n\n\"Lee will face pressure to resign as the court allows time for a change of candidate, but I think the Democratic Party will go ahead with him,\" Park predicted.\n\nThe DP held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss Lee's fate, and decided it would stick with him. The party criticized the Supreme Court ruling and said it has no plans to name an alternative candidate.\n\nPolitical analyst Rhee Jong-hoon told Reuters that whatever the DP might be saying in public, it will almost certainly discuss a \"Plan B\" behind closed doors, possibly including an outreach to minor parties to form a coalition around a different candidate.\n\n\"The appeals court will decide whether to disqualify him to run for office or not, but the Supreme Court in effect found him guilty,\" noted Myongji University political science professor Shin Yul. \"Moderate voters, 10% of the total, will be swayed by this news.\"\n\nLee himself seemingly argued that the election should be the ultimate verdict on his actions, rendered by the South Korean people.\n\n\"It was a totally different direction of ruling from what I thought,\" he said of the Supreme Court decision. \"Law is a consensus of people, and people's will matters the most.\"",

            "title": "Adams' $115B 'Best Budget Ever' is chocked full of freebies fit for...",
            "body": "Mayor Eric Adams served up a $115 billion election year spending plan Thursday that's stuffed with voter-pleasing goodies, but that was still slammed by critics for squirreling away relatively little for a rainy day.\n\nHizzoner, who faces an uphill re-election battle, unveiled his 2026 executive budget during a campaign-like event from his alma mater Bayside High School in Queens, rather than City Hall, from which such announcements have traditionally been done.\n\n\"This is not a budget that favors the few. It is budget for all of you,\" Adams said, while flanked by students. \"In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that our fiscal Year 2026 executive budget is the best budget ever.\"\n\nThe budget lavishes $1.4 billion on programs and services that had faced cuts -- such as libraries, early child education and the City University of New York.\n\nIt also launches a universal after-school program and increases education funding by $376 million.\n\nThe spending plan is the largest Adams has proposed since taking office in 2022, with last year's executive budget proposal coming in at $111.6 billion.\n\n\"Welcome to the election year!\" said veteran campaign strategist Hank Sheinkopf, adding that incumbent mayors usually throw caution to the wind when seeking a second term.\n\n\"An election year means living in the moment. Tomorrow, next year is a long time away,\" Sheinkopf told The Post. \"It's 'spend whatever we can now.' It's like a bank robbery.\"\n\nCritics quickly pounced on Adams seemingly failing to plan for the possibility of tough economic times in the near future, from President Trump's tariffs, a widely anticipated upcoming recession and potential federal funding cuts.\n\n\"Despite being flush with cash, Mayor Eric Adams' Fiscal Year 2026 Executive Budget fails to address the dual threats of looming federal budget cuts and a possible recession,\" said Andrew Rein, president of the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group Citizens Budget Commission.\n\n\"Instead of wisely adding $1 billion in next year's General Reserve to soften the first blows of federal cuts and $2 billion to the Rainy Day Fund, the budget increases spending to an unaffordable level.\"\n\nRein said the city should have between $8 and $10 billion in reserves for potential choppy economic waters -- a sum that city budget Director Jacques Jiha agreed would be needed, if the Big Apple were in a \"doomsday\" scenario.\n\n\"We're not looking at doomsday, we're looking at a slowdown in the economy,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe we have adequate reserves.\"\n\nAdams' preliminary budget, released in January, was blasted by opponents, including in the progressive City Council, for needlessly cutting services.\n\nBut his administration maintained those slashes were necessary due to skyrocketing costs from the migrant crisis -- which Jiha said has now cost the city more than $7 billion.\n\nThe mayor had begged Albany lawmakers in February for $1.1 billion to deal with the migrant crisis, contending then that the city needed it in 12 weeks.\n\nCity Hall officials offered nary a peep about the ask since then -- and the supposed shortfall apparently has been covered by savings, with Jiha saying only \"Money is fungible\" as an explanation.\n\nThe budget announced Thursday is Adams' first since the crisis largely subsided, and includes these spending increases and reversed cuts:\n\n\"Adams is using this budget to promote his re-election. He doesn't want to have much of a fight with the council,\" said Nicole Gelinas, senior fellow at the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"It's pre-emptive capitulation to the council,\" she added, noting Adams was proposing $1.7 billion more in spending compared to his preliminary budget.\n\n\"Adams is blowing out the agency spending,\" Gelinas said. \"[He] is squandering the last of his budget credibility.\"\n\nNot all programs and departments saw a funding increase. The following budget cuts were included in the plan:\n\nTalks with City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is not related to Hizzoner and is running for the Democratic mayoral nomination, will continue until the June 30 deadline to pass the budget.\n\nAdams' plan offered plenty of fodder from candidates hoping to boot him from Gracie Mansion, such as City Comptroller Brad Lander -- who claimed the mayor was \"failing to protect New Yorkers\" by not putting more cash in reserves.\n\nFormer city comptroller and current mayoral candidate Scott Stringer also blasted Adams for failing to prepare for a potential \"extraordinary loss of funding for New York City.\"\n\nAdrienne Adams offered less gloom and doom -- though she still cautioned against getting too comfortable.\n\n\"I think that the budget right now is good, but we can never be too certain about what is coming around the corner with this Trump administration,\" she said.\n\nAdams, who boasted of confronting then-President Joe Biden for migrant funding, hasn't been nearly as vocal about his growing ally Trump.\n\nHe said he hasn't been in contact with the White House, even as he acknowledged that the current global climate was creating \"uncharted waters.\"\n\nAdams' top deputy, however, was quick to put a positive spin on the potential financial woes.\n\n\"We are best positioned to address with Washington those issues going forward,\" said First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro. \"Even asking a question about a doomsday scenario is to be with those pessimistic and political opportunists who don't bet on New York, who are saying, 'The sky is falling.'",

            "body": "Warning: This story contains an image of a Nazi symbol.\n\nThousands of campaign posters -- cable-tied to fences and lining the streets -- each emblazoned with a candidate's name and portrait.\n\nAnd while stealing or vandalising corflutes isn't new, political experts are warning dirty tactics are becoming more common in some tight electorates.\n\nElection signs have been marked with swastikas or offensive slurs, burned, vandalised, smeared with excrement, stomped on and shredded, especially in marginal seats.\n\nPolitics lecturer Dr Blair Williams from Monash University said the high volume of reports, and their severity, was worrying.\n\n\"Much of what we're seeing on corflutes kind of relates to that increased polarisation, increased normalisation of hate speech,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not surprising that we're seeing that trickle down into politics on the streets.\"\n\nSome vandals caught on camera\n\nIn the marginal seat of Mackellar in Sydney's north, independent MP Sophie Scamps said about 500 of her electoral signs had been \"slashed and destroyed\" over the past month.\n\nPictures circulating on social media show a man appearing to take down a number of Ms Scamps's posters and using a knife to shred them.\n\n\"People find such aggression at best puerile, at worst deeply threatening,\" Ms Scamps said.\n\n\"The electorate has been covered in bright yellow, denigrating and misleading posters and ads about me. After the actions of Professor Malham in Kooyong have illustrated, I'm not sure we can say this is just healthy democracy.\"\n\nMs Scamps was referring to Melbourne neurosurgeon, Professor Greg Malham, after a video circulated of a man tearing down a poster of independent MP Monique Ryan in the marginal Melbourne seat of Kooyong.\n\nNine Newspapers reported Professor Malham admitted to being the man in the video and apologised.\n\nMs Ryan told the ABC the video was \"deeply concerning\" but was far from an isolated incident.\n\n\"We've seen groups from both within and outside Kooyong stoking division through aggressively negative advertising,\" she said.\n\n\"It's creating a climate of hostility that is distressing to candidates, volunteers, and the broader community.\"\n\n\"There's no place in Australian electoral campaigns or society for violence and aggression.\"\n\nMs Ryan said more than 200 of her corflutes had been torn down and defaced, sometimes with very distressing messages or symbols put on them.\n\n\"It's been a really tough election campaign nationally, things are heightened, and there's a lot of tension,\" she said.\n\nMs Ryan herself copped criticism earlier in the campaign, after her husband was caught on video removing a sign of her Liberal opponent Amelia Hamer.\n\nPeter Jordan apologised for the incident, saying he believed the sign was illegally placed.\n\n'Violent' vandalism and incidents of physical assault\n\nSome attacks on signage have also turned physically violent.\n\nIn Ashfield in Sydney's inner west, a 79-year-old man was taken to hospital in a serious condition after an alleged assault outside a polling booth in Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's electorate of Grayndler.\n\nThe ABC understands the elderly man was confronted after defacing one of Mr Albanese's corflutes. A 17-year-old boy has been charged over the incident.\n\nElsewhere in Sydney, in the seat of Bennelong, a 30-year-old man was charged with intimidation after kicking a number of signs and allegedly becoming aggressive towards volunteers at the booth.\n\nA number of police investigations have been conducted in the hotly-contested seat of Calare in the New South Wales Central West, where the Nationals are hoping to win against sitting independent Andrew Gee.\n\nIn a statement, Detective Inspector Jason Darcy said there had been examples of malicious damage and people being abusive to others at a number of polling centres across NSW \"due to heightened emotions ahead of the federal election\".\n\n\"The message is clear -- this is not what police want to see and there will be no tolerance for any behaviour that could harm others at any time anywhere,\" Detective Inspector Darcy said.\n\n\"It is disappointing when it seems to be conveying a bit of violence,\" independent candidate Kate Hook said.\n\nOther corflutes in the electorate have been targeted with racist remarks or stolen, while Nazi symbols have been scrawled on billboards.\n\nIn another marginal seat, Liberal candidate for Wentworth Ro Knox has also had hundreds of posters vandalised or stolen -- some even set on fire or smeared with animal faeces.\n\nMany in the Sydney seat, currently held by independent Allegra Spender, have also been vandalised with anti-Semitic symbols and language.\n\nMs Knox said she understood many residents were fed up with the \"poster wars\", and pledged to not use campaign posters on public property in the next campaign if elected.\n\n\"We're all over the waste, the visual pollution, the silly games where people are tearing down and defacing posters,\" she said.\n\nDeputy Greens leader Mehreen Faruqi, whose signs have been targeted, said the problem was getting worse.\n\n\"What's happening out there clearly goes beyond ordinary vandalism -- this is politically motivated hate,\" she told the ABC.\n\nAustralian National University political marketing lecturer Andrew Hughes said the worst instances of vandalism appeared to be in seats with three of four candidates, particularly where a teal or independent candidate was running.\n\n\"All of a sudden a lot of these races are too hard to call so people revert to, sadly, aggressive behaviour like this to get their candidate elected again,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to accept we're entering a new era where traditional two-way races between major party candidates will become a thing of the past in some areas, even areas where we thought that wouldn't happen like Calare, like Wannon.\"\n\nMr Hughes said the behaviour actually worked against the candidate the vandal thought they were helping.\n\n\"You notice the sign left untouched and then people start thinking: 'Hang on, that party's playing dirty,'\" he said.\n\nPauline Hanson's One Nation party has also been targeted, with a man who hid his face with a mask caught on video slashing through candidate Stuart Bonds's corflutes in the electorate of Hunter in New South Wales.\n\nFrustrated locals or far-right actors?\n\nSo who is behind the attacks? Dr Blair Williams said the culprits were likely a mix of bored teenagers, supporters of political opponents, and extremists. And in many instances, it's hard to tell.\n\n\"I can imagine some of the people stealing signs would be frustrated community members ... whether it be the cost of living crisis or what's happening in Gaza,\" she said.\n\n\"But then there are the more insidious actors. In the last federal election some corflutes were defaced by neo-Nazi groups with neo-Nazi signage, and you're seeing some more hate speech vandalism as well this election.\"",

            "title": "Sanity returns as feds condemn transgender treatments for kids",
            "body": "The United States has finally acknowledged the truth: Sex-change treatments endanger children.\n\nOn Thursday, the federal Department of Health and Human Services issued the world's most comprehensive report on the topic to date -- a definitive 400-page evidentiary and ethical takedown.\n\nTransgender activists have long relied on the support of the US government -- or at least its silence -- to protect their claimed medical and moral legitimacy and continue treatment on children as young as age 8.\n\nNow they have nowhere to turn but the fringe, which is where their ideology arose and ought to return.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about this report is that it took so long.\n\nOther nations, especially in Europe, have conducted their own reviews of the evidence in recent years.\n\nThey have broadly concluded that treatments like puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex-change surgeries have more documented risks than potential benefits for children.\n\nLast summer, for example, Great Britain all but banned the use of puberty blockers -- the first and foundational treatment in child sex-change procedures -- after the publication of a National Health Service report by Dr. Hilary Cass.\n\nYet the US government has refused to grapple with the evidence, much less admit it, until now.\n\nIn the meantime, at least 14,000 American children have been subjected to these interventions, as our organization has documented.\n\nThe HHS report notes from the start that medical practitioners have a \"professional and ethical obligation to protect and promote their patients' health.\"\n\nThat obligation strongly counsels against hormones and surgeries for children, since, as the report notes, there's little evidence of benefits of sex-change treatments -- but plenty of proof of their harm.\n\nThe evidence shows that sex changes for children can lead to infertility, sterility, cognitive problems, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, mental-health disorders and more.\n\nAnd, as the report also notes, additional suffering may soon come to light -- because existing studies fail \"to systematically track and report harms.\"\n\nWe already know, as the report makes clear, that child sex changes are happening amid a broader mental-health crisis among kids.\n\nPsychotherapy, not experimental drugs and invasive surgeries, is necessary to treat underlying mental issues like anxiety and depression.\n\nActivists have mischaracterized psychotherapy as \"conversion therapy,\" the HHS report notes -- yet Britain and the Scandinavian countries now recommend these non-invasive treatments as the primary intervention.\n\nThe unnamed authors don't mince words about what medical professionals should -- and shouldn't -- do in cases of gender distress.\n\n\"When medical interventions pose unnecessary, disproportionate risks of harm, health care providers should refuse to offer them,\" they instruct, \"even when they are preferred, requested, or demanded by patients.\"\n\nFailing to heed this guidance, they write, threatens the foundations of medicine itself.\n\nHonest medical practitioners and experts have known from the beginning that child transgender treatments are risky and largely experimental.\n\nYet honesty was never the goal for many activists, as the HHS report also shows.\n\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which publishes the most widely used child treatment guidelines, \"suppressed systematic reviews its leaders believed would undermine its favored treatment approach.\"\n\nWPATH's guideline developers also \"eliminated nearly all recommended age minimums for medical and surgical interventions in response to political pressures.\"\n\nThis is the definition of putting ideology ahead of evidence.\n\nNow the HHS report must shape government action.\n\nIt provides the necessary scientific support to implement President Trump's January order to \"take all appropriate actions to end\" treatments that endanger children.\n\nThat could include ending Medicare and Medicaid coverage of such treatments -- and perhaps private health-insurance coverage as well.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget has sought to block federal research and education grants to institutions that perform child sex-change treatments, and the report adds weight to that effort.\n\nThe findings should also spur National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to release the results of its decade-long study on the effects of puberty-blocking drugs on children.\n\nThat study's author, prominent transgender activist Johanna Olson-Kennedy, has refused to release the data -- while admitting they didn't show promised mental-health improvements.\n\nNIH should now fund new, non-biased studies to analyze the effects of sex-change treatments on those who received them as children, including the rates of regret and the prevalence of de-transitioning.\n\nThursday's report proves that our federal government is finally willing to put medical science ahead of gender activism.\n\nWashington has sided with ideologues for too long, giving cover to the notion that sex changes for children are consequence-free and medically necessary.\n\nIn fact, the proven harms outweigh unproven benefits.\n\nBy finally speaking truth to the activists' power, the United States has taken the most important global step yet in protecting children from transgender ideology.",

            "title": "China Detains Investors Who Complained About State-Linked Financial Scam",
            "body": "Chinese police have reportedly detained dozens of small investors who were scammed out of their money by a state-linked investment group, accusing the victims of acting on behalf of \"overseas anti-China forces\" by airing their grievances in public.\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is the Shandong Jianghaihui Financial Group, a government-supported investment company headquartered in Shandong province. The company abruptly ceased operations in March, and its founder fled to the United States along with his wife.\n\nRoughly 100,000 small investors were angered to discover their $2.74 billion in investments went up in smoke when the financial group dissolved. When the Chinese government seemed disinclined to do anything about it, the defrauded investors began talking to reporters -- and the government very quickly did something about them.\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Wednesday that dozens of victimized depositors, most of them women, have been detained by the police after they tried to get around the Communist regime's embargo on news coverage of the Shandong Jianghaihui story by talking to foreign reporters, including RFA itself.\n\n\"All the people who had contacted you from here were detained,\" a source in Shandong told RFA. \"They said we were being used by international anti-China forces and that we were all committing crimes.\"\n\nAccording to RFA's sources, Chinese police looked for news reports about the Shandong financial collapse on foreign websites, got the names of the sources for their stories, and started rounding them up. Some of the unfortunate depositors were released within a matter of days, while others are in detention to this day.\n\nThere are several reasons the Chinese Communist Party regards this story as so troublesome. The regime is deeply worried about deteriorating public morale as U.S. tariffs bite into China's export economy, so this is an exceptionally bad time for dozens of middle-class women to be talking about how an unscrupulous financial company stole their life savings.\n\nEven worse, the anguished depositors say the government is partly to blame for the Shandong scandal, because oversight of the company was very lax, to say the least. Victims say they invested with the company because they believed its activities were part of the Chinese government's efforts to stimulate private enterprise.\n\nRFA noted a group of defrauded investors wrote the Chinese Communist Party's disciplinary commission and the Ministry of Public Security to ask for help recovering their money. Their letter pointedly asked why the government was describing Shandong Jianghaihui's activities as \"illegal fundraising,\" as if they were some sort of private charitable organization, rather than \"contract fraud.\"\n\nThe reason for this elusive rhetoric is most likely that the financial company held government-issued business licenses and passed government audits for years -- just like a number of other financial companies over the past few years whose owners stuffed company cash in their pockets and fled overseas right before their investment schemes came crashing down.\n\nAnother example was a company called Zhongrong International Trust, which held $108 billion in assets at its peak, but went bankrupt in 2024. Chinese officials began the process of liquidating the trust's assets on April 15, prompting large protests by empty-handed investors that were studiously ignored by Chinese state media -- but not by dissidents such as the famed \"Mr. Li Is Not Your Teacher\" social media account:\n\nMr. Li noted that over a hundred of the demonstrators, including \"the elderly, women, and cancer patients,\" were \"violently dragged\" from the scene of the Zhongrong Trust protest by police.",

            "title": "Exclusive  --  Leading Romanian Politician: Let's 'Make Europe Great Again'",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- George Simion, the leading candidate in the upcoming Romanian presidential election, told Breitbart News that if he wins and if a similarly conservative anti-globalist candidate wins in Poland in presidential elections in May that President Donald Trump will have two major new allies in the European Union.\n\nRomania had elected hardline conservative anti-globalist Calin Georgescu late last year, but the election was called off and nullified after he was accused of being pro-Russian. Romanians scheduled a new election for May, and Simion -- who has promised Georgescu a position in his government if he wins -- has emerged as the front-running candidate. Protests have erupted across Romania with people objecting to interference in their elections from Brussels, globalist plotters who canceled Georgescu's victory.\n\nSimion was in Washington in mid-April to meet with top conservatives close to President Trump and during his visit sat for an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.\n\nAsked about the anger from the people that the international community has seen since Georgescu's victory was nullified by globalists, Simion told Breitbart News: \"Would't you be?\"\n\n\"You would storm onto the streets and you would be protesting in a manner that you would harangue them -- the guys that did the coup d'etat, the establishment guys, the deep state guys combined with our public government,\" Simeon told Breitbart News. \"They were losing big time -- they were organizing the elections and they lost big time. So they renounced the elections because they didn't like Georgescu's stances. They said he had pro Russia stances. It's arguable, but -- it's arguable that Donald Trump did this. We have a globalist ambassador here and the U.S. has a globalist ambassador to Bucharest, also a Biden woman, they said Simion was in Russia making antisemitic statements. He was phoning people around Washington. I've never been to Moscow. They said okay Georgescu had pro-Russian stances. Last I checked, this is not forbidden by the Constitution and the electoral law. Of course, I would never have pro-Russian stances. Nobody in Romania would win with a pro-Russian stances actually. Russia did the biggest harm to us in the last hundred years in order to have a population that loves Russia or Russians.\"\n\nSimion is not concerned that they might be able to do to him what they did to Georgescu because now the whole world is watching and Brussels-based globalists and other far-left actors in Romania cannot get away with it. But he does expect some leftist shenanigans and is prepared to fight it out to victory.\n\n\"It would be too much now that everybody is looking,\" Simion said. \"We have international observers. Nobody was expecting this inside a country inside the European Union. It is too much to annul the election. They will try some scams. They will try to rig some votes and steal some ballots. This is usual for them because they are liars and they are thieves. They will do anything in their power to keep their power.\"\n\nSimion and several other candidates will face off on Sunday in a first round of the presidential election. The top two vote-getters in the May 4 contest will advance to a May 18 final head-to-head election, and Brussels is quite literally freaking out that Simion might win. Recent polling has had him double digits ahead of everyone else in the race, but he's still only in the mid-30s, so while he is expected to finish atop the field on Sunday, he's got to then within two weeks really close it down and win big getting majority support on May 18 to become Romania's next president.\n\n\"Polls will be however you have some psychological phenomenon, silent spiral, but I'm leading big time yes,\" Simion said when asked about the polls, adding that he's ready for a real fight with the globalist elites in the home stretch.\n\n\"They were expecting, 'okay, we will dismantle him through the MSM. We will kill him,'\" Simion said. \"This is why in this election people are already going to vote. Some people are already casting their ballots in the U.S. and Canada abroad -- the Romanians abroad -- some of them already voted in the voting stations, not by mail. So yes, this is one of the reasons I'm here, to spread the word and sound the alarm that they are not democrats but authoritarian tyrants that want to control Romania and they are allowed and are ordered by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.\"\n\nRomania is one of the European Union's 27 member nations. Located in Eastern Europe, it borders Ukraine, and the threats from Russia are very real to Romanians. Romanians have gone decades without a leader like Simion -- and he has come to lead a movement of disenfranchised Romanians who feel like their votes were stolen last year.\n\n\"First of all, it's not about me. It's the fact I'm continuing this sovereign-ist movement, a representative of this sovereign-ist movement started by Calin Georgescu,\" Simion told Breitbart News. \"I'm his replacement. People are upset and they want their president back. Their president is Georgescu and we will bring him to power through these elections and all the means that is necessary. Second, of course, it will be the first time in Romania in the last 35 years where we have had a patriotic, sovereign-ist president. So this is the reason they are voting for me. I'm 38 years old. I will fight. The ideals of the Romanian Revolution of 1989 will be transformed into reality. People died hoping that we have free elections, democracy, and freedom. We forgot about this. It turns out the fight continues for freedom and all of our lives. You must fight generation to generation, and you must win. So this is what we are doing right now.\"\n\nSimion said the movement politics of working class people rejecting globalists -- what's happened in the U.S. and might be happening in Romania -- is \"of course a reaction, an allergic reaction or an antibody reaction, from the people against all these crazy ideas and ideologies and crazy stuff like lies about how cows are polluting and we must kill the cows, we must kill the grandmothers, and we must kill everybody because we have a death culture and Satanic ideology behind us.\"\n\n\"It's common sense that people are supporting and returning to their roots and returning to normality,\" Simion said.\n\nSimion said he knows that if he wins he will be the most likely of any of the remaining candidates to have warm relations with President Trump and the United States. Simion also mentioned that Poland, which is also having its presidential elections in May, has a similar opportunity to elect a fresh young anti-globalist conservative. The two of them are essentially running as a ticket, freaking Brussels out even more.\n\n\"I am not hoping -- I know,\" he replied when asked if he hopes to have close relations with Trump if he wins. \"I am the only one who has channels to the Trump administration. The Trump administration doesn't want to talk with our public government selected by Brussels. Yes, America would be our main focus and key strategic partner. We are the natural partners and we are ideologically the same with the MAGA movement. You can consider me a MAGA candidate -- the only MAGA candidate in the Romanian election. But what's more interesting and important is I'm also supporting the Polish candidate in their presidential elections on the same day in Poland. Karol Nawrocki, the successor of Andrzej Duda, is the candidate of the party of Mr. [Jaros\u0142aw] Kaczy\u0144ski. We would be two presidents that if we win the elections in May would be pro-Trump presidents, pro-freedom presidents, and against the Brussels bureaucracy.\"\n\nWhen Breitbart News told him of the very positive view of President Trump this reporter found in Greece recently, Simion said Trump has far more support across Europe than globalist institutions like the establishment media would have anyone believe. He mentioned how close he and other conservative leaders are with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni -- this interview was conducted right after Meloni's visit to the White House.\n\n\"I'm sure this is the fact,\" Simion said. \"In Romania, President Trump in their fake polls from the 27 states has the biggest approval rating of his actions. I think what we started and continue the MAGA movement with MEGA -- Make Europe Great Again, I'm the co-founder of that in Europe -- we will be victorious. I think it's a matter of time after winning in Romania and Poland before we have a majority of governments across the 27 states of the European Union that are pro-Trump and MAGA-oriented. This is what we have to do -- we are in the European party of Giorgia Meloni. Giorgia is our dear friend and leader. Yesterday she was at the White House.\"\n\nSimion said he agrees with Meloni's and Trump's comments from the Italian leader's White House visit where they pledged to Make the West Great Again. He also said how he and others across Europe believe the globalists at the European Union headquarters in Brussels need to be put in check.\n\n\"Absolutely, when you define the West, you talk about Italy,\" Simion said. \"And she managed to make it, she has it in Italy many times, Italia Protaginsta. She managed in only two years to do it and be a model. So yes, I would think we would have a series of pro-Trump leaders across Europe who are winning and will deal directly with the Trump administration and which will stop Ursula von der Leyen and these nasty people that remind us of crooked Joe Biden.\"\n\nSimion added that given that Romania shares a border with Ukraine, his country has unique credibility among European Union member nations on how to deal with Russia and Ukraine. He said that Russia is a malign actor in the region and cannot be trusted.\n\n\"Russia is a big danger for us, for Poland, for the Baltic states,\" Simion said. \"We must stop Russia. But what's happening right now is not stopping Russia, it's only making Russia become an important actor again. This war doesn't go anywhere. Of course it's condemnable and you cannot ask for a country to give up territory. But we have to deescalate the conflict. I hope and pray President Trump will do so and obtain a ceasefire and peace negotiations. It's the only way possible, with new security guarantees for the next 40 to 50 years so that Russia doesn't do this again because it's like an MO from their part... We need new security guarantees.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Trump's tariffs, Simion said Trump's speeches throughout his career made it \"obvious\" the president was focused on China with them.\n\n\"It's obvious that the tariffs were not targeting the European countries,\" Simion said. \"It was just stupid Emmanuel Macron who tried to put tariffs on the digital products from the United States and I'm sure we will find a solution in the economic relationship with the United States. Of course, the tariffs are about China -- only if you listen to the speeches of the last 10 years of Donald Trump you would understand this. But some pretend they do not understand. So if America wouldn't have done this now, in 10 years Americans wouldn't be the biggest power in the world. It's something you need to do, and it's something we need to do, because we stopped producing in our countries and we have had some not so smart people influencing things like experts and university professors who were saying you could live like this forever not producing anything but having the good life. We should get our jobs back and we should get our production back in Europe and in America and only then we can really stop others from growing.\"\n\nHe said too that he hopes after the elections in Romania and Poland that are upcoming that Trump and the U.S. will have friends in the presidencies of two major European nations in just a few weeks' time.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that after the end of May, America will regain two of its important partners -- both Romania and Poland,\" Simion said. \"We are committed not only to the idea of friendship between Romania and the United States but also to the values I know on which we stand -- freedom of speech, democracy, common sense.\"",

            "body": "Taxpayers may get their gooses cooked paying for a duck massacre.\n\nA Long Island duck farm is asking for the federal government to quack up $1 million after it euthanized 100,000 of its flocks over bird flu fears, documents show.\n\nCrescent Duck Farm, which supplies 4% of the nation's duck meat, has already received $150,000 from the USDA and is asking for more after it put down tens of thousands of birds -- and now animal activists are slamming the cost and the carnage.\n\nThe farm used carbon dioxide foam, then snapped the necks of surviving birds with a handheld scissor-like tool called the Koechner Euthanizing Device, according to USDA documents.\n\n\"If you see videos of it, it looks like a scene from a horror movie,\" Ben Williamson, the executive director of Animal Outlook, told The Post of the foam. \"It doesn't knock them out, it doesn't stun them. They essentially will suffocate, and will be conscious while they're suffocating ... and then the ones who survive have their necks rung by these devices.\"\n\nBut Crescent Duck Farm owner Doug Corwin told The Post the UDSA ended up using a different killing method, and the farm \"had nothing to do with whatever was decided upon.\"\n\n\"This was a heartbreaking thing,\" he added. \"We had no standing in that.\"\n\nA request for comment from the USDA was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 116-year-old farm on the North Fork estimated it was owed $811,635 from the government due to the mass culling after 700 Peking ducks died from the virus in January, records show.\n\nThe requested funds were used for sanitization, disposal and replacement of roughly $166,365 in losses, the farm said. Corwin told The Post the USDA has reimbursed to date \"about 10%\" of what the flock was worth,\" or about $150,000, and is expecting more.\n\nLong Island animal activists weren't taken by the sob story -- or use of government cash.\n\n\"New Yorkers don't go to work with the intention of spending our hard-earned money on a multimillion-dollar enterprise that kills a million 6-week-old ducklings a year while they're still peeping,\" said John Di Leonardo, executive director of animal rights group Humane Long Island.\n\nPoultry farms and live markets are mandated to kill inventory when highly-contagious bird flu is detected, and dozens of outbreaks have torn through New York State in 2025, according to the USDA website.\n\nThe first case of bird flu in the U.S. was detected in 2022 and has since resulted in the deaths of an estimated 166 million birds. Toxic carbon dioxide foam is used in culling about half of the time, per a USDA report, and require secondary measures to kill surviving ducks about 29% of the time.\n\nDespite the culling at Crescent, The Post reported in February that more than 3,700 new ducklings hatched at an off-site location.\n\nThe ducks can return to the North Fork once barns are found to be free of any active avian flu DNA, Corwin said, adding the barns were last tested Monday.\n\n\"The ducks are nine weeks old and in good shape,\" Corwin said. \"We're hoping to bring them home when we can - when its 100% safe to do so.\"\n\nWilliamson told The Post he will be presenting an offer to the farm on Thursday to help the business transition to crop production instead, which he deems more \"humane and sustainable\" than duck farming.\n\n\"While we recognize Crescent Duck Farm's historical significance to Long Island, the documents we've obtained reveal not just the financial cost to taxpayers, but also the grim reality of how these birds met their end,\" he said.\n\nCorwin, however, balked at the idea of scrapping his beloved ducks for farming lettuce and other vegetation.\n\n\"It's going to take me a year and a half to get any income off of this place [after the culling],\" he said. \"I'd be better off to bulldoze every barn we have and put it up for sale, but I'm a farmer at heart.\"",

            "title": "Maduro Regime Denies Colombia's Claim that Marxist Terrorist Group Is Operating in Venezuela",
            "body": "The socialist regime of Venezuelan President Nicol\u00e1s Maduro rejected claims made by far-left Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday that Colombian drug trafficker Jobanis de Jes\u00fas \u00c1vila Villadiego has formed an alliance with the National Liberation Army (ELN) Marxist terror group in Venezuelan territory.\n\nVilladiego, also known as Chiquito malo (\"Bad Little Boy\"), is the current leader of the Colombian Clan del Golfo drug cartel, succeeding its previous leader Dairo \"Otoniel\" \u00dasuga David after he was arrested in 2021 and sentenced to 45 years on numerous drug trafficking charges in 2023.\n\nPetro, through a Wednesday Twitter post, asserted that Villadiego had formed an alliance with ELN inside the territory of neighboring Venezuela. Petro added that Colombian authorities have already seized 32 tons of cocaine from the Catatumbo region and arrested \"several mayors and politicians who were helping the drug traffickers.\"\n\n\"Crop substitution in Catatumbo is essential to achieving peace. Violence in the Caribbean revolves around ports and extortion. I've decided to change the entire port administration,\" Petro's message said.\n\n\"There will be a special meeting today to intensify the offensive against Clan del Golfo,\" he continued. \"I expect from the Caribbean citizens, and with due confidentiality, information to find the leaders of the Clan.\"\n\nPetro's statements drew fierce criticism from the socialist Maduro regime.\n\nThe Colombian newspaper El Tiempo reported on Wednesday that it had obtained a copy of an official letter sent by the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry to its Colombian counterpart protesting Petro's social media post and rejecting being held responsible for \"dynamics that have their origin and expansion in Colombian territory.\"\n\n\"Such statements, deeply inconsiderate, constitute a petty expression that ignores the firm commitment of the Venezuelan State to the fight against drug trafficking and transnational organized crime, as well as the important operational efforts that the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) have been carrying out for weeks to safeguard national sovereignty,\" the note said.\n\nColombia's Catatumbo region is presently the epicenter of a gruesome conflict between the Marxist ELN and the equally Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) terrorist group over control of the region's coca leaf crops, the main ingredient used in the manufacture of cocaine.\n\nThe conflict dramatically escalated in mid-January after ELN broke a tacit \"non-aggression\" pact that both terror groups had agreed upon in 2022 and which established limits on their respective areas of influence and illicit economic activities. The ongoing conflict left nearly 100 dead and over 60,000 local residents displaced as of March.\n\nSeveral reports published in recent years have denounced that ELN began a process of expansion in Venezuelan territory that has effectively turned it into a \"bi-national\" guerilla force.\n\nAlthough ELN has historically used Venezuela as a \"refuge\" from Colombian law enforcement operations since the 1980s, the Marxist terrorist group established a firm foothold in Venezuelan territory thanks to its friendly ties with the Venezuelan socialist regime, first established under the auspices of late dictator Hugo Ch\u00e1vez.\n\nUnnamed human rights activists cited by the Venezuelan outlet Armando Info in April explained that ELN has a permanent presence \"along the entire border\" between both countries, especially in the neighboring states of Zulia and T\u00e1chira, and has used Venezuelan territory to stage operations in Colombia since at least 2020.\n\nVenezuelan Interior Minister -- and actively wanted drug lord -- Diosdado Cabello refuted Petro's accusations during the latest broadcast of his weekly socialist show Hitting with the Mallet, urging Petro to \"not bring Venezuela into your problems.\"\n\n\"I always ask myself why he [Petro] has to drag Venezuela into his schemes. In Venezuela we are fighting a frontal battle against all the drug trafficking, paramilitary, and terrorist mafias. What was achieved in Venezuela was thanks to Venezuelan Intelligence and Counterintelligence,\" Cabello claimed.\n\n\"Why does the President of Colombia have to meddle with Venezuela? The problem is where the drugs are produced. Venezuela has deployed more than 5,000 troops of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces and police throughout its territory,\" he added.\n\nCabello urged Colombia to stop blaming the Venezuelan regime and describing the neighboring country as \"neighbors who throw stones at neighbors and you have to respond.\"",

I represent them, but don't put their families at risk.

ICE and HSI racially terrorize and criminalize entire communities with their policies. They kidnap people from their homes and from the streets, separating families and fracturing communities.

            "body": "The U.S. Justice Department filed lawsuits against four states this week, claiming their climate actions conflict with federal authority and President Donald Trump's energy dominance agenda.\n\nThe DOJ on Wednesday filed lawsuits against Hawaii and Michigan over their planned legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change. On Thursday, the DOJ sued New York and Vermont, challenging their climate superfund laws that would force fossil fuel companies to pay into state-based funds based on previous greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"These burdensome and ideologically motivated laws and lawsuits threaten American energy independence and our country's economic and national security,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice is working to 'Unleash American Energy' by stopping these illegitimate impediments to the production of affordable, reliable energy that Americans deserve.\"\n\nThe DOJ lawsuits, which legal experts say are unprecedented, mark the latest of the Trump administration's attacks on environmental work and raises concern over states' abilities to retain the power to take climate action without federal opposition.\n\nDOJ's court filings said the states' plans and policies \"impermissibly regulate out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions and obstruct the Clean Air Act's comprehensive federal-state framework and EPA's regulatory discretion.\"\n\nThe DOJ cited the Clean Air Act -- a federal law authorizing the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate air emissions -- saying it creates \"a program for regulating air pollution in the United States and \"displaces\" the ability of States to regulate greenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders.\"\n\nDOJ argued Wednesday that Hawaii and Michigan are violating the intent of the Act that enables the EPA authority to set nationwide standards for greenhouse gases, citing the states' expected litigation against oil and gas companies for alleged climate damage.\n\nDemocratic Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel last year tapped private law firms to go after the fossil fuel industry for negatively affecting the state's climate and environment.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Hawaii Governor Josh Green plans to target fossil fuel companies that he said should take responsibility for their role in the state's climate impacts, including 2023's deadly Lahaina wildfire.\n\nWhen burned, fossil fuels release emissions such as carbon dioxide that warm the planet.\n\nA spokesperson for Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's office deferred to Nessel when asked for comment.\n\n\"This lawsuit is at best frivolous and arguably sanctionable,\" Nessel said in a statement, which noted that Michigan hasn't filed a lawsuit. \"If the White House or Big Oil wish to challenge our claims, they can do so when our lawsuit is filed; they will not succeed in any attempt to preemptively bar our access to make our claims in the courts. I remain undeterred in my intention to file this lawsuit the President and his Big Oil donors so fear.\"\n\nGreen's office and the Hawaii Attorney General's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Thursday's filings called the states' Superfund Acts -- modeled on the 45-year-old federal superfund law enacted to address the harm associated with hazardous waste sites -- \"a transparent monetary-extraction scheme.\" Trump has suggested the superfund laws \"extort\" payments from energy entities.\n\nNew York is looking for $75 billion and has been previously challenged by 22 states for the law; Vermont hasn't specified what it is seeking. Both laws were approved last year.\n\n\"By purporting to regulate the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change, the Act necessarily reaches far beyond\" the states of New York and Vermont, the DOJ argued, saying the states are incorrectly looking to regulate nationwide and global airspace.\n\nThe offices of New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Attorney General Letitia James, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark did not immediately return emailed requests for comment.\n\n\"At a time when States should be contributing to a national effort to secure reliable sources of domestic energy,\" all four states are choosing \"to stand in the way,\" all four filings said.\n\nIn its filings, the DOJ repeated the Republican president's claims of America's energy emergency and crisis.\n\nBut legal experts raised concern over the government's arguments.\n\nMichael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said usual procedure is the DOJ asking a court to intervene in pending environmental litigation -- as is the case in some instances across the country.\n\nWhile this week's suits are consistent with Trump's plans to oppose state actions that interfere with energy dominance, \"it's highly unusual,\" Gerrard told The Associated Press of the cases of Hawaii and Michigan. \"What we expected is they would intervene in the pending lawsuits, not to try to preempt or prevent a lawsuit from being filed. It's an aggressive move in support of the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\"It raises all kinds of eyebrows,\" he added. \"It's an intimidation tactic, and it's telling the fossil fuel companies how much Trump loves them.\"\n\nAnn Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has previously consulted on climate litigation, said this week's lawsuits look \"like DOJ grasping at straws,\" noting that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said his agency is seeking to overturn a finding under the Clean Air Act that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.\n\n\"So on the one hand the U.S. is saying Michigan, and other states, can't regulate greenhouse gases because the Clean Air Act does so and therefore preempts states from regulating,\" Carlson said. \"On the other hand the U.S. is trying to say that the Clean Air Act should not be used to regulate. The hypocrisy is pretty stunning.\"\n\nTrump's administration has aggressively targeted climate policy in the name of fossil fuel investment. Federal agencies have announced plans to bolster coal power, roll back landmark water and air regulations, block renewable energy sources and double down on oil and gas expansion.",

            "body": "Want to stay updated on what's happening in Iraq and Syria? Sign up for Your Places: Global Update, and we'll send our latest coverage to your inbox.\n\nPresident Trump's deep cuts to foreign aid have compromised efforts to repatriate tens of thousands of Islamic State members and their families living in camps in the Syrian desert, three inspectors general said on Wednesday in a report to Congress.\n\nIn the report, the inspectors general described how the cuts had created security lapses, slowed repatriation efforts and interrupted the distribution of humanitarian aid at the sprawling al-Hol camp and other outposts where former Islamic State residents have been held while their home governments try to reintegrate them into society.\n\nThe report was a quarterly update to Congress on the status of the yearslong campaign to defeat ISIS, known as Operation Inherent Resolve. The inspectors general were from the Defense and State departments, as well as from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was the government's main conduit for distributing foreign aid before the Trump administration largely dismantled it earlier this year.\n\nThe United States policy has been that repatriating residents of camps like al-Hol and its smaller neighbor, Roj, is the only way to keep ISIS from regaining strength in the Middle East. The presence of militants in the camps and the poor living conditions have made them fertile recruiting grounds. U.S. officials have also said repatriations are a necessary step toward relieving the United States of financial responsibility for the camps.\n\nBut major reductions in American aid have hobbled that effort, the report said. No Syrians left al-Hol to return to their homes in the first three months of the year because \"key project activities identifying, preparing, and receiving Syrian returnees were halted,\" according to the inspectors general report.\n\nIn addition, the report said pauses in security funding at al-Hol and Roj had led to periods of looting and protests, and a rise in attempts to smuggle people in and out of the camps. By the end of March, al-Hol housed about 36,000 people, most of them children, while Roj camp had another 2,400. They are not allowed to leave without permission.\n\nDuring the first quarter, about 1,500 families were transported from al-Hol and Roj to a camp just over the border in Iraq called Jeddah 1, which functions as a rehabilitation center for Iraqi returnees and is heavily financed by the United States, the report said. The Trump administration made an exception to the general freeze of foreign aid to provide money to the camp for clean water, health services and waste management.\n\nStill, by the end of the quarter, the Jeddah 1 center \"faced significant challenges in sustaining comprehensive humanitarian support\" because of the termination of U.S.-backed programs to help educate, employ, and integrate returnees into their home communities, the report said.\n\nThere were also shortfalls at Jeddah 1 in services for women and girls who had experienced violence, the inspectors general wrote. An uptick in begging was observed, caused by, among other things, the suspension of cash-for-work programs and delays in the delivery of food rations, the report said.\n\nIn addition, the termination of U.S. support for the World Health Organization has compromised efforts to ensure returnees sent to Jeddah 1 could get medicine, mental health services, and treatment for chronic conditions, the report said -- all of which had previously been considered important to helping people who had been affiliated with or under the influence of ISIS to return to normal life.\n\nThe White House, the Pentagon and the State Department did not immediately respond to a requests for comment about the report.\n\nAll told, Syria lost eight U.S.A.I.D. stabilization awards in the first quarter of the year, bringing its U.S.-backed portfolio of foreign aid projects down to just three. Iraq saw 20 U.S.A.I.D. stabilization awards cut, leaving it with just two.",

Therefore, the Subcommittee is investigating whether additional legislation regarding requirements of NGBs of amateur sports, like USFA, is necessary to address these issues.\"\n\nFEMALE FENCER DEFENDS PROTEST AGAINST TRANSGENDER OPPONENT\n\nLehfeldt and Andrews have both publicly expressed their support for allowing transgender women to compete on biological women's sports teams. House Republicans' decision to subpoena Lehfeldt follows an incident when a female fencer named Stephanie Turner was punished by USA Fencing for refusing to compete against a transgender competitor earlier this year.\n\nTurner, during a regional meet in March, refused to compete against a transgender competitor who previously had competed in the men's division. A video of her taking a symbolic knee at the start of the match, eventually earning her a \"black card,\" fencing's most severe penalty, went viral following the incident.\n\nENGLAND SPORTS GOVERNING BODY BANS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES FROM WOMEN'S SOCCER FOLLOWING UK COURT RULING\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"In fencing, personally, I see it quite often,\" Turner said following the incident. \"I have witnessed transgender fencers in women's tournaments and girls' tournaments in different age categories, specifically Y-14 (the youngest age group).\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to USA Fencing for comment but did not immediately receive a response.",

            "body": "Western Australia has a reputation for moving at a slower pace.\n\nOur capital city is known as a big country town, WA sometimes stands for Wait Awhile, and visiting comedians thank us for going to their \"late-night\" shows at 8.30pm.\n\nWe were the last colony to join the Australian federation in 1901. And on Saturday, we'll be the last to vote in the election.\n\nBut 2022 has become a stark reminder of why the audience shouldn't leave the stadium before Westralia runs its race.\n\nIn a tight sprint to the finish at the last federal election, it was WA's votes which pushed Anthony Albanese into the Lodge.\n\nYes, our time zone means the federal election could technically be over while we're still scrambling to the polling booths.\n\nBut if the race is close, sandgropers could once again be the kingmakers of this federal election.\n\nWA priorities clear\n\nThe campaign has been all about the cost of living, but there are a few issues specific to WA.\n\nOnce a political afterthought, the state has become a prime location for politicians racking up frequent-flyer points.\n\nAnthony Albanese has made a point of visiting WA more than 30 times during his prime ministership.\n\nPeter Dutton has accumulated less points, but has frequented the state more lately.\n\nBoth Labor and the Liberals have agreed to uphold WA's GST deal, which will cost the federal budget a measly $53 billion (and counting) over 10 years through to 2029-30. West Aussies can breathe a sigh of relief there.\n\nPeter Dutton has also promised to \"turbocharge\" jobs and investment in the mining and resources sector.\n\nThe seats on the line\n\nLet's take a look at where the federal priorities lie.\n\nWestern Australia is home to the country's only new electorate this election -- Bullwinkel.\n\nIt's a mish-mash of suburban and rural voters, spanning from the rural Wheatbelt to the city's fringe.\n\nThe diversity of issues in an electorate so wide-ranging makes it a difficult race to pick between Labor, Liberal, and the Nationals.\n\nWestern Australia is also home to the country's most marginal teal independent seat -- affluent, beachside Curtin.\n\nThe Liberal Party have deployed former international Uber executive Tom White to take on Climate 200-backed Kate Chaney.\n\nFormer dolphin trainer (and police officer) Sam Lim made a splash at the last federal election with a surprise win in the seat of Tangney.\n\nIt's Labor's most marginal seat in the state, previously held by the Liberals since 1984. Liberal candidate Howard Ong will be hoping to flip this key seat in Perth's south back to blue.\n\nIn the seat of Moore, incumbent Liberal-MP-turned-independent Ian Goodenough is threatening to up-end more than three decades of Liberal reign.\n\nMr Goodenough was ousted by his own party at preselection -- a move he said could've ignited a \"civil war\" at the time -- and will be taking on his replacement as Liberal candidate, former army officer Vince Connelly and Labor's Tom French.\n\nThe seat of Fremantle has been red for more than 90 years, held by Labor heavyweights including John Curtin and Kim Beazley Sr.\n\nLabor's Josh Wilson will be looking to maintain that record against an independent -- Kate Hulett -- who came just 424 votes off ousting Labor's state MP in the WA election two months ago.",

            "title": "Two wannabe PMs, a media pack and the search for gold",
            "body": "As Albanese and Dutton crisscrossed the country aiming to win over voters, ABC photographers were there to capture the best images of the campaign.\n\nOver 35 days, politicians have donned hi-vis, sizzled sausages, shaken hands, and cuddled babies. All in the name of winning tomorrow's federal election.\n\nFor the party leaders, their media managers and the journalists accompanying them on the campaign trail, the days are long, the schedule is relentless, and the stakes are high. For the photographers, a large media scrum means muscling into the best position to take the winning image.\n\n\"[The crowd] makes it very, very difficult to navigate and to look for what we call gold -- a gold moment,\" ABC Chief Photographer Brendan Esposito says. Gold, according to the veteran photographer, is a moment of \"authenticity\" when \"the character of the person\" shines through.\n\nBut authentic moments can be hard to find. \"[The leaders] are all smooth, they're really guarded now, and they are polished in their performance, and everything is down to clockwork,\" Esposito says.\n\nEarly in the campaign, Peter Dutton visited the Assyrian New Year festivities at Fairfield in Western Sydney. \"He started to dance with a guy, and it was just a little jig,\" Esposito says. \"It wasn't anything fancy, but it was something that showed this guy, actually he does have humour. There is a lighter side to Peter.\"\n\nIt was a good moment because Peter doesn't give much away, Esposito says. \"My observations with him is that I think he's quite a shy man.\"\n\nLabor's Chris Bowen was at the same event and he and Dutton met unexpectedly. \"Bowen's face said it all. He was visibly uncomfortable,\" Esposito says.\n\nDespite careful choreography from media advisors and advancers, who arrive at a location ahead of time scouting for potential surprises and unwanted signs -- the iconic 2015 image of a beaming Tony Abbott snapped in front of giant yellow letters saying \"The Reject\" springs to mind -- on the campaign trail, sometimes the unexpected happens.\n\nThere was the moment the prime minister fell off a stage in Cessnock, in NSW, which became a Coalition attack point after Anthony Albanese initially said he hadn't fallen. Then there was the stray football Dutton kicked into the head of a camera operator.\n\n\"They like to have things heavily stage managed [but] it's exciting, you just never know what's going to happen,\" says ABC photographer Adam Kennedy, who is covering his sixth federal election.\n\n\"You don't get this access to the PM and the opposition leader out and about doing things throughout the normal political cycle. They'll go do a press conference here and there, but it's nothing like this.\"\n\nA photo can be powerful, it \"can turn an election\", ABC photographer Ian Cutmore believes.\n\nThis campaign, there have been a lot of protesters, he says. Early on a Rising Tide climate protester is shown shouting at Albanese, while on Tuesday, Dutton's plans went awry when anti-nuclear union protesters crashed a press conference in the marginal NSW seat of Gilmore - Dutton was whisked away by his minders and did not speak at the event.\n\n\"It does give you an idea of how fraught campaigning can be when these unexpected moments happen,\" ABC reporter Pablo Vi\u00f1ales said live on air at the time.\n\nThe role of the photographer on the campaign trail is to \"capture the event as well as capturing the person and who they are, to try to show the public what they're like,\" Cutmore says.\n\nFinding ways to illustrate what journalists are talking about can mean looking for the little things -- a gesture or an expression.\n\n\"Albo's got more facial expressions, but Dutton, he's got his head, which is a bit of a character you can just have a bit of fun with,\" Kennedy says.\n\nCutmore agrees. \"It's easier with Albanese because he's usually a bit more dynamic and expressive so he's always got interesting facial expressions and body language and hand gestures but Dutton is a lot harder,\" he says.\n\nThe obligatory photo ops of politicians with babies and children have been plentiful.\n\nFor Kennedy, this image of Albanese meeting three girls in outer Melbourne is his favourite. The girls lived next door to a family Albanese was meeting with, Kennedy says, and they simply ambushed the PM as he was leaving the event.\n\n\"There's a girl with her fingers intertwined like Monty Burns, watching. And then there's this tiny little girl staring up at the prime minister. She's got no fear.... The middle [girl] who's just sort of happy there in front of all these cameras.\"\n\nFor Cutmore, capturing Dutton having fun playing two-up at an RSL in Townsville on Anzac Day is one of his favourites. \"He was talking to all the people in the room. He was just a lot more relaxed and casual.\"\n\nIt can feel ridiculous when 30 members of the media are crowded into a cafe as a politician has a conversation with a family about the cost of living, Matt Roberts says. \"You take a step back and realise how silly and set up a lot of these things are but ...that's part of Australian political history, we've been doing this [campaign style] a long time and in a weird way it's sort of unique and charming.\"",

            "body": "Orland Mayorquin reported from Los Angeles, Robert Chiarito from Chicago, and Aishvarya Kavi from Washington.\n\nAnnual May Day rallies in cities across the country swelled with thousands of anti-Trump demonstrators on Thursday, as outcry continued to grow over the president's agenda and expansion of executive power.\n\nProtesters denounced the administration's effort to roll back workers' rights -- a particular sore spot on a day dedicated to celebrating organized labor -- as well as plans to cut education funding and carry out mass deportations.\n\n\"We're here to support our workers and our union,\" said Jena Olsen, 63, who has been a flight attendant for 39 years, at a large rally in Chicago's Union Park. But demonstrators said they were also angry about the \"threat to democracy\" posed by President Trump.\n\n\"I think the two coexist,\" Ms. Olsen said, \"and this huge turnout shows that.\"\n\nA separate effort, which organizers billed as a National Law Day of Action, brought legal professionals to the Supreme Court in Washington and federal courthouses across the country on Thursday to push for judicial independence and oppose efforts to intimidate law firms.\n\nThe lawyers demonstrating at the Supreme Court reaffirmed their oaths to serve with integrity and to protect the rule of law -- principles that do not appear to interest Mr. Trump, said Fabiola Gretzinger, 28. \"He thinks he's above it,\" she said.\n\nPolice closed streets for the crowds in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington. But protesters also rallied in small communities that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, including places like Norman, Okla., Sauk City, Wis., and Hendersonville, N.C. Groups held signs in front of municipal buildings and public schools, and some demonstrators wore red to indicate support for public education.\n\nA rally in downtown Los Angeles began early on Thursday and focused largely on migrant rights. Jose Serv\u00edn, 31, an organizer for a statewide coalition of advocacy groups who helped set up for the rally, held a sign that read, \"Come for one of us, come for all of us.\"\n\nMr. Servin immigrated to the United States as a child, he said. \"I found a place here where I can succeed, where I can thrive, where I can plant roots -- I'm a father now -- and I'm going to fight like hell to protect that,\" he said.\n\nThe protests -- more than 1,000 were expected across the country -- were spearheaded to coincide with traditional May Day labor rallies by 50501, a loose coalition of grass-roots activist groups, as well as by labor, nonprofit and civil rights organizations. May Day commemorates the struggle for an eight-hour workday, won by labor organizers in 1886 only after clashes in Chicago resulted in the deadly Haymarket Riot.\n\nLabor groups made up a significant portion of demonstrators at the rally in Chicago on Thursday, though pro-Palestinian activists and anti-Trump demonstrators swelled their ranks, and many saw their concerns as overlapping.\n\n\"He's tearing apart our Constitution,\" said Bill Hincks, 40, a union official from the Chicago suburb of Oak Forest, who faulted Mr. Trump for firing officials at agencies that regulate workplace safety, including at the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to quell dissent in corporate America, universities, government agencies and the news media. But in recent weeks, demonstrations opposing the president's agenda, as well as resistance from some of the institutions targeted by Mr. Trump, have increased in size and frequency.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat who first ran for office in 2018 because of his revulsion to Mr. Trump's first term, called for an even larger outcry during a speech on Sunday in New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's time to fight everywhere, and all at once,\" he said.\n\nKatie Benner contributed from Washington.",

            "title": "Fernandes at the double as Manchester United cruise against 10-man Athletic Bilbao",
            "body": "Manchester United enjoyed their night in Bilbao so much that they will surely be coming back. They remain the only unbeaten team among the more than 100 that have played in the Europa League over eight long months, and even if they do fall to a first defeat in seven days' time, they should be there on its final game in this same stadium, this season given meaning and potentially a triumphant end.\n\nThey came to the stadium everyone calls the Cathedral and defeated Athletic Club so convincingly that the second leg carries little threat. No one had won here this year in this competition and Athletic had conceded just 10 times in all competitions; United scored three in a quarter of an hour.\n\nAn opening goal from Casmeiro and two from Bruno Frenandes, the first of those from the spot and accompanied by a red card for Dani Viviain, destroyed the dreams of the faithful here and virtually ensured that they will return on 21 May against Spurs or Bod\u00f8/Glimt.\n\nUltimately this was an efficient, impressive performance in which United looked something like the team, and club, they are supposed to be: one that can win a European title that has become their salvation and a glimpse, perhaps of future hope, not least as it would give them Champions League access. One that ended up looking on a different level to their opponents.\n\nAthletic had started strongly too, forcing the first corner and the first roar inside 90 seconds. While United sought to slow the game down, the home side wanted to accelerate it. United's possession was not so much a platform for them to do something as for Athletic to, ready to asphyxiate their opponents, rob and then go at them. That front-footed approach, though, did open them to the ball behind and just four minutes in, Manuel Ugarte slipped into the right channel and released Alejandro Garncho scored what he thought was the opener. That was offside, but it was also a warning, an invitation to United to seek the same wing.\n\nIt would work too and repeatedly. Andr\u00e9 Onana had to save from Alex Berenguer, I\u00f1aki Williams headed just over and when he then raced up the right and pulled back, Victor Lindelof twice had to make decisive interventions. The second of those, made almost on the line with Berenguer shooting from five yards out, really should have been the opener. Instead, having resisted the pressure, the red and white shirts coming at them, it was United that would get it just before the half hour.\n\nIt was made by United's unlikely hero doing unlikely things. More unlikely even than last time, although the moment was not as dramatic. Harry Maguire, the emergency striker who had completed the most astonishing comeback against Lyon, smacking in a header on 121 minutes to send Old Trafford wild, now went all Stanley Matthews to momentarily silence San Mam\u00e9s. If that had been latter-day Ronaldo, this was more like his teenage incarnation.\n\nFaced by Mikel Jauregizar, Maguire went up the right, stopped, turned one way and the next, then started up again, going past the midfielder and delivering the cross. Manuel Ugarte headed it on and, at the far post, Casemiro arrived to nod into the net. United had a lead that was swiftly doubled, and in a way that gave them even more of an advantage than the goal they scored, two minutes enough to virtually terminate the tie.\n\nAgain, it started on the right, where United had always identified opportunity. When the ball from Noussair Mazraoui came across the six-yard box, Rasmus H\u00f8jlund went down. Dani Vivian went straight to him and accused him of diving but the defender was protesting too much and if he had got away with it the first time ultimately he would pay for what he had done; H\u00f8jlund may have been quick to go to ground but there had been a clear hand on his shoulder and when the referee Espen Esk\u00e5s came back from the VAR screen where he was shown what he had not seen live, he pointed to the spot and pulled out a red card.\n\nVivian departed, Fernandes rolled in the penalty and this, it seemed, was done. I\u00f1aki Williams did bend a shot wide but Athletic appeared gone and United added a third. H\u00f8jlund scrambled for the ball, Ugarte provided the clever flick and Fernandes ran through to finish high into the net. The lead might even have extended still further before half-time, when Mazraoui smashed one off the bar.\n\nThe protests and the feeling of injustice which accompanied them off at the break increased early in the second when the referee was called to the screen to have another look at the moment when Maguire pulled down Maroan Sannadi. He decided that was no red card, any tiny hope that the numbers might be evened out, and a comeback would start, snuffed out. Instead, United controlled this, never in any danger. They managed it with a certain comfort, a sense of clear superiority, and the threat - if not an actual need - of extending the lead still further. There was another penalty appeal from H\u00f8jlund, this time tangling with Yuri Berchiche. Ugarte and Casemiro both took aim from distance and the Brazilian put a header against the post.\n\nWilliams went sprinting up the pitch soon after, but Athletic were exhausted now, defeated, and those chances were a reminder that this could still get worse. For Manchester United, it could hardly get any better, and they will surely be back.",

            "body": "Global elites are fast-tracking geoengineering under the guise of \"climate intervention,\" bypassing public scrutiny.\n\nIn a brazen move that defies both science and sanity, geoengineers are now pushing to weaponize commercial airliners in a radical experiment to alter Earth's climate. A new study published in Earth's Future reveals plans to retrofit Boeing 777 jets to dump millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the lower stratosphere -- a scheme that could trigger catastrophic acid rain, poison ecosystems, and accelerate the very environmental collapse it claims to prevent.\n\nThe study, authored by researchers from University College London and Yale, admits the plan would \"strongly increase side-effects such as acid rain\" due to the sheer volume of sulfur required. Unlike high-altitude aerosol injection (SAI), which requires specialized aircraft, this shortcut relies on existing jets flying at just 42,000 feet -- ensuring the toxic particles rain down faster and in greater concentrations.\n\nThe irony is staggering: To \"save\" the planet from climate change, they're willing to flood it with poison.\n\nThe study's authors openly concede that their low-altitude sulfur-dumping strategy is \"sub-optimal\" -- meaning it's less effective, more dangerous, and disproportionately harms polar regions. Yet they advocate for it anyway, citing \"lower technical barriers\" and the ability to deploy faster.\n\nThis isn't science. It's a corporate-military power grab disguised as environmentalism.\n\nThe push for geoengineering is nothing new. For decades, global elites have weaponized weather under the guise of \"environmental stewardship.\" In the 20th century, cloud seeding was used to manipulate rainfall. Now, they've escalated to stratospheric aerosol injection -- a far more dangerous game.\n\nThe study compares the sulfur output to the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which temporarily cooled the planet but also triggered widespread acid rain and ozone depletion. Yet, unlike a natural disaster, this would be a permanent, man-made atmospheric regime -- one that, once started, cannot be stopped without triggering \"termination shock\" -- a sudden, catastrophic warming spike.\n\nThe geoengineering-industrial complex is already lining up for taxpayer-funded contracts. Britain's Aria agency is preparing field experiments, while defense contractors and aerospace giants like Boeing could cash in on retrofitting fleets.\n\nMeanwhile, the public is kept in the dark. No democratic debate. No informed consent. Just a silent coup against the sky itself.\n\nThis isn't about saving the planet. It's about control -- engineering dependence on a toxic, irreversible atmospheric intervention. The same corporate and governmental forces that wrecked the environment with industrialization now seek to \"fix\" it by dousing the skies in sulfur.\n\nAs the study admits, this plan is flawed, dangerous, and inefficient -- yet it's being fast-tracked anyway. The question isn't whether they can do it. The question is: Will we let them, or will government enforce new state laws combating geoengineering?",

            "body": "Geopolitical Risks: China has weaponized rare earth exports in past trade disputes; rising U.S.-China tensions could disrupt supply chains, crippling AI, drones, and renewable energy sectors.\n\nA new investigative report has exposed a looming crisis for the United States' ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics: China's near-total control over rare earth minerals essential for manufacturing advanced technology. With the U.S. heavily reliant on Chinese exports, experts warn that America's ability to scale up AI-driven robotics -- critical for military, medical, and industrial applications -- is at serious risk.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is neodymium, a rare earth element vital for producing high-performance magnets used in actuators -- the components that enable robotic movement. Without neodymium, the production of advanced robots grinds to a halt.\n\n\"If you don't have neodymium, you can't make actuators. And if you can't make actuators, you can't make robots,\" warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, in a recent analysis. \"Guess who controls the world's neodymium output? China, with a near-monopoly.\"\n\nChina currently dominates over 90% of global rare earth production, including dysprosium and praseodymium, which are also crucial for heat-resistant magnets in robotics and electric vehicles. The U.S., meanwhile, has fallen dangerously behind in domestic extraction and refining capabilities.\n\nRecognizing the vulnerability, the Trump administration recently signed a mineral extraction deal with Ukraine, part of a broader strategy to secure alternative sources of rare earths. Similar negotiations are reportedly underway with African nations.\n\n\"Whoever makes the best robots -- and the most robots -- will dominate wars, economic competition, aerospace, and medicine,\" Adams notes. However, analysts caution that these efforts may be too little, too late. Even with new mining agreements, China's refining infrastructure and supply chain dominance mean breaking free from dependence will take years -- if it's possible at all.\n\nThe stakes extend far beyond robotics. AI development, military drones, medical devices, and even renewable energy technologies like wind turbines rely on these minerals. A supply disruption could cripple multiple industries, leaving the U.S. scrambling for alternatives.\n\nMeanwhile, China has shown a willingness to weaponize its rare earth dominance. In past trade disputes, it has restricted exports to pressure other nations. With tensions rising between Washington and Beijing, the risk of such tactics being used again is high.\n\nThe U.S. must accelerate domestic mining and processing capabilities while forging alliances with mineral-rich nations. But time is running short. As Adams puts it: \"The race for robot supremacy is really a race for rare earth control -- and right now, China is winning.\"\n\nFor now, America's AI and robotics future hinges on a precarious supply chain -- one controlled by its greatest geopolitical rival.\n\nWatch the May 1 episode of \"Brighteon Broadcast News\" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about minerals deals, elemental crisis, Walmart, China and robots...it's all connected.\n\nELEMENTAL CRISIS: How China and Russia Control the Critical Minerals Needed for AI, Military Robots, and Economic Domination\n\nTrump's critical Ukraine minerals deal nears completion",

I remain undeterred in my intention to file this lawsuit the president and his big oil donors so fear.\"\n\nGreen's office and the Hawaii attorney general's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut legal experts raised concern over the government's arguments.\n\nMichael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said usual procedure is for the justice department to ask for a court to intervene in pending environmental litigation - as is the case in some instances across the country.\n\nWhile this week's suits are consistent with Trump's plans to oppose state actions that interfere with energy dominance, \"it's highly unusual\", Gerrard told the Associated Press. \"What we expected is they would intervene in the pending lawsuits, not to try to preempt or prevent a lawsuit from being filed. It's an aggressive move in support of the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\"It raises all kinds of eyebrows,\" he added. \"It's an intimidation tactic, and it's telling the fossil fuel companies how much Trump loves them.\"\n\nAnn Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has previously consulted on climate litigation, said this week's lawsuits look \"like DoJ grasping at straws\", noting that the EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, said his agency is seeking to overturn a finding under the Clean Air Act that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.\n\n\"So on the one hand the US is saying Michigan, and other states, can't regulate greenhouse gases because the Clean Air Act does so and therefore preempts states from regulating,\" Carlson said. \"On the other hand the US is trying to say that the Clean Air Act should not be used to regulate. The hypocrisy is pretty stunning.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has aggressively targeted climate policy in the name of fossil fuel investment. Federal agencies have announced plans to bolster coal power, roll back landmark water and air regulations, block renewable energy sources, and double down on oil and gas expansion.",

            "title": "Have The Intermittent Energy Blackouts Begun?",
            "body": "Today there have been widespread electricity blackouts across Europe, beginning in Spain and Portugal in the early afternoon (local time), and then spreading to other countries including France, Andorra, Belgium and the Netherlands. Is this related to the increasing penetration of intermittent generation from wind and solar facilities?\n\nFor years, many in the climate skeptic community have warned that expansion of intermittent renewable electricity generation on the grid will, sooner or later, lead to frequent blackouts. The reason for the warning is easy to understand: The grid has some rather exacting operational requirements that the intermittent renewable generation technologies cannot fulfill. Primary among these requirements are, first, minute-by-minute matching of electricity supply with electricity demand and, second, grid-wide synchronization of the frequency of the alternating current. When wind and solar provided relatively small portions of the electricity consumed, other generation sources, particularly thermal (fossil fuel) and hydro, would fulfill these requirements. But as wind and solar come to dominate generation, the problems become much more difficult to solve.\n\nHere at Manhattan Contrarian, I have mostly steered clear of covering this topic. Although I think I understand the main issues, I am certainly not a grid engineer. And there are many smart people who are engineers and who have the job of \"balancing\" the grid to keep it consistently up and running in the face of the challenges of intermittent wind and solar generation. Maybe they can succeed. I doubt it. But I definitely have wanted to avoid \"crying wolf,\" predicting over and over that frequent blackouts are imminent, only to find that the engineers have come up with solutions that seem to work reasonably well.\n\nAs of this writing, it does not appear that a definitive cause (or causes) of today's blackouts has been established. However, there is every reason to think that the increasing penetration of wind and solar generation in Spain is the most important part of the problem. Here are links to some articles that have appeared so far today: this one from the Daily Mail at 8:41 AM EDT (which would be 2:41 PM in Spain); this one from Yahoo News at 10:21 AM EDT (4:21 PM in Spain); and this one from Climate Change Dispatch (no time indicated, but based on a paywalled piece from the Telegraph, with a time stamp of 3:21 BST).\n\nAccording to the piece in the Daily Mail, Spain's state electricity network operator, known as Red Electric, reported that today's problem began with \"'a very strong oscillation' in the electrical network [that] caused Spain's power system to 'disconnect from the European system.'\" On the question of the initial cause of the \"oscillation,\" there is only speculation. Proposed causes range from \"extreme temperature variations along very high-voltage power lines in Spain,\" to a hacking attack.\n\nBut whatever the initial cause of the \"oscillation,\" what is clear is that the Spanish system then lacked the ability to respond sufficiently to keep the power on. Why? The Daily Mail puts forth a very plausible explanation of grid instability resulting from heavy reliance on wind and solar generation. The Mail attributes the theory to \"some analysts\" (unnamed):\n\n[S]ome analysts have suggested that the Spanish grid operator's reliance on renewable energy sources to supply the majority of the nation's electricity could have led to the blackout. Traditional generators, like coal and hydroelectric plants or gas turbines, are connected directly to the grid via heavy spinning machines. When turned on, these massive machines are in constant motion and the inertia created by their weight and momentum acts like a shock absorber, helping to insulate the grid against a sudden disturbance - for example, in the event of a transmission failure. Solar and wind power do not provide the natural inertia generated by these so-called 'spinning machines', leaving the grid more vulnerable to disruptions and subsequent oscillations in the electrical frequency.\n\nJust before the blackout hit, it seems that solar facilities were generating over 60% of Spain's electricity:\n\nAt 12:30pm local time today - five minutes before the widespread blackouts occurred - solar power was generating some 60% of Spain's electricity. . . .\n\nBut how about wind generation? This is from the Yahoo News piece:\n\nSpain has one of Europe's highest proportions of renewable energy, providing about 56pc of the nation's electricity. More than half of its renewables comes from wind with the rest from solar and other sources. That means Spain's electricity supplies are increasingly reliant on the weather delivering enough wind to balance its grid. For much of the last 24 hours, that wind has been largely missing. The website Windy.com, for example, shows wind speeds of 2-3mph, leaving the country reliant on solar energy and old gas-fired power stations.\n\nSo when the \"oscillation\" occurred, what is going to keep the grid steady on its 50 Hz frequency? From Michael Schellenberger today on X:\n\n[A]ll of Europe appears to have been seconds away a continent-wide blackout. The grid frequency across continental Europe plunged to 49.85 hertz -- just a hair above the red-line collapse threshold. The normal operating frequency for Europe's power grid is 50.00 Hz, kept with an extremely tight margin of \u00b10.1 Hz. Anything outside \u00b10.2 Hz triggers major emergency actions. If the frequency had fallen just another 0.3 Hz -- below 49.5 Hz -- Europe could have suffered a system-wide cascading blackout.\n\nThe bottom line is that there were multi-hour blackouts in many places today. A random \"oscillation\" of some sort, which could have been easily handled in a world of fossil fuel power plants, became a huge problem when wind and solar generators could not respond to it appropriately. And so people were stuck for hours in elevators or subway trains; traffic lights went dark; banking and cell phone networks stopped working; and so forth. But within a few hours all of those were back in business.\n\nSo was this really a big deal? As Schellenberger points out, with just \"a hair\" more frequency variation it could have been far worse. Will that happen some time soon? I'm not going to pretend I know. But I do know that the electricity system in most of Europe and many U.S. states is in the hands of crazed fanatics who have no idea what they are doing. My own bet would be that there are many far worse blackouts to come, until this idiotic \"net zero\" thing is abandoned.",

            "title": "State Dept. denies China takeover of reef near Philippines, calls unfurling of flag 'provocative'",
            "body": "China has not taken over a disputed islet near a key Philippines island despite a provocative Chinese coast guard operation last month to plant a flag on the reef, the State Department said.\n\nChinese state media announced recently that its coast guard in mid-April carried out a \"maritime control\" activity over what Beijing calls Tiexian Reef and the Philippines calls Sandy Cay.\n\nReports showed a group of camouflaged Chinese troops holding a flag there in a bid to assert sovereignty over the small islet in the Spratly Islands.\n\nDays after the photo of the Chinese flag was published, troops from the Philippine coast guard, navy and police landed on the 180-square-yard reef and were photographed holding a Philippines flag on April 25.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chinese warships were dispatched to the area amid official charges by Beijing that the Philippines is engaged in \"disturbances.\"\n\nThe Philippines military said in a statement, also on Tuesday, that U.S. and Philippines air forces carried out a joint patrol over the South China Sea to highlight joint defense cooperation. The air patrol included three Philippines FA-50 fighter jets, two U.S. B-1B bombers, two F-16s and an F-18.\n\nA State Department official denied the islet was overrun by China.\n\n\"China's provocative flag unfurling is detrimental to preserving peace and stability in the region and is the latest example of its repeated escalatory and irresponsible actions in the South China Sea,\" the official told The Washington Times.\n\n\"Contrary to media reports, China has not 'seized' Sandy Cay and the feature remains unoccupied,\" the official said.\n\nWashington remains in close communications with Philippines officials regarding the attempt to assert Chinese sovereignty, the official said.\n\nThe dual flag-planting and claims over the reef are the latest round in mounting tensions between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea.\n\nSandy Cay is less than three miles from the Philippines island of Pagasa that hosts military forces and a civilian population.\n\nPegasa, also called Thitu Island, is the location of a Japanese-built radar system and is used for training by the Philippine navy's special warfare group.\n\nThe island also has a coast guard base that was set up in 2023 to counter what Manila called Chinese aggression in the region.\n\nChina claims 90% of the South China Sea, including the Spratlys, which are near the main Philippines island of Luzon.\n\nChina's South China Sea sovereignty claim was struck down as illegal by an international arbitral tribunal in 2016, although China rejected the ruling and has continued provocative actions in a bid to assert control over the South China Sea.\n\nThe sea is a major strategic waterway that sees between an estimated $3.5 trillion and $5 trillion annually in trade.\n\nChina's military has seized a number of disputed islands since 2012 and built military bases on several that are now armed with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nChina and the Philippines recently have engaged in a series of low-level confrontations in the region involving the ramming of vessels, the firing of water cannon by Chinese ships and, in at least two cases, China's use of lasers against Philippines aircraft and vessels.\n\nThe State Department has declared several times in recent years that any Chinese attack on the Philippines over disputed islands could trigger the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty.\n\nHowever, Navy forces have taken no action to intervene in the sea confrontations.\n\nChina's state CCTV broadcaster said the landing on Sandy Cay was designed to \"exercise sovereignty and jurisdiction,\" to carry out an \"inspection,\" and \"collect video evidence regarding the illegal activities of the Philippine side.\"\n\nThe People's Liberation Army said Tuesday that the southern theater command dispatched warships in the South China Sea on routine patrols.\n\n\"Recently, the Philippines has been frequently carrying out maritime infringement provocations, creating disturbances and pulling in countries from outside the region to organize so-called 'joint patrols,'\" it said.\n\n\"Troops in the theater of operations are maintaining a high level of alert, resolutely defending the country's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and resolutely safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea region.\"\n\nThe Chinese sovereignty claim over Sandy Cay has raised concerns among U.S. and Philippines officials that the operation there will signal a new expansion of the Chinese military's island reclamation project.\n\nIn 2012, China took over Scarborough Shoal in the Spratlys and the Obama administration took no action against the takeover.\n\nThe lack of a response set in motion a major Chinese island-building campaign that resulted in new PLA bases on several reefs, including Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef and Subi Reef.\n\nRetired Navy Capt. Jim Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence director, said the latest attempted island grab by China is \"another step in the continuation of the [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party's Great Rejuvenation strategy to 'restore' territory they falsely assert is theirs.\"\n\n\"The world has witnessed, since 2012 at Scarborough Shoal, the People's Republic of China take physical possession and control of the vast majority of the South China Sea,\" he said in an email.\n\nCapt. Fanell said more than a decade of \"doing nothing\" against the Chinese maritime sovereignty campaign demonstrates that U.S. resolve has eroded and that American national security and naval forces in the Pacific are at great risk, as well as those of U.S. allies.\n\nHe urged the Trump administration to counter the Chinese maritime aggression by dispatching Navy warships to the sea. \"It is long past time to dispatch the Seventh Fleet to these waters to prevent or disrupt any PRC effort to seize another inch of territory from our treaty ally,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not a call to war, but a call to stand up and push back.\"\n\nCarl O. Schuster, also a retired Navy captain, said the photo op on Sandy Cay appears to be a variant of China's 1990s tactic of planting \"border\" markers on uninhabited atolls, islets and cays.\n\nThe objective is to create false evidence used to back the Beijing narrative of ownership over the South China Sea.\n\nPhilippines authorities landing on the Cay and photographing their flag seek to counter the Chinese operation.\n\n\"This incident was a test to determine how Manila and Washington would react,\" Capt. Schuster said.\n\n\"Had the Philippines done nothing but protest, the PRC would have initiated the next step -- construction of a 'fishing shelter' for its fishing community operating in the area,\" he said. \"However, Manila's response has interrupted China's narratives and immediate plans.\"\n\nThe current standoff in the South China Sea comes as U.S. military forces are engaged in a major annual exercise with the Philippines known as Balikatan.\n\nThe exercises have included the deployment of long-range U.S. land-attack missiles and a new remotely controlled anti-ship missile system.\n\nThe exercises and the missile deployments were denounced by China as destabilizing.",

            "title": "IMF and World Bank: Crony Covid Crackdown Enablers",
            "body": "What should the US government expect when Congress and endless presidents give the World Bank and IMF billions of US tax dollars to play with? The US government is on the hook for $52 billion to the World Bank. The US has a financial commitment of $183 billion to the IMF.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained last week that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are suffering from \"mission creep.\" But Bessent announced that Trump will be \"doubling down\" on supporting the largest foreign aid gushers on earth. \"Far from stepping back, 'America First' seeks to expand U.S. leadership in international institutions like the I.M.F. and World Bank,\" Bessent declared.\n\nBessent complained that the IMF \"devotes disproportionate time and resources to work on climate change, gender, and social issues.\" Unfortunately, Bessent said nothing about how the IMF and World Bank bankrolled many of the worst crony Covid crackdown policies.\n\nBut what should the US government expect when Congress and endless presidents give the World Bank and IMF billions of US tax dollars to play with? The US government is on the hook for $52 billion to the World Bank. The US has a financial commitment of $183 billion to the IMF.\n\nThe IMF was created in 1944 to shore up currencies and help nations with temporary balance-of-payment problems. In the decades since the IMF's founding, global capital markets and fluctuating currency exchange rates have made the IMF a relic. But too many people have gotten rich from IMF largesse to permit the curtain to be closed on this institution.\n\nThe IMF enabled scores of governments that chose to pointlessly shut down their own economies after the outbreak of Covid-19. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva declared in April 2021, \"While the recovery [from Covid] is underway, too many countries are falling behind and economic inequality is worsening. Strong policy action is needed to give everyone a fair shot -- a shot in the arm to end the pandemic everywhere, and a shot at a better future for vulnerable people and countries.\"\n\nThe IMF's \"fair shot\" consisted of its international bureaucrats providing scores of billions of dollars in \"emergency financing\" to 80 governments, most of whom exploited Covid to stretch their own power. The IMF provided emergency relief via the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) to 29 governments to supposedly help them \"combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The IMF's deluge of handouts to government helped fuel the worldwide inflation surge in recent years.\n\nThe World Bank President Ajay Banga \"has sought to emphasize the bank's focus on job creation...and to prioritize private sector involvement in projects around the world,\" the New York Times reported. But the World Bank's notion of the private sector has often been either a fraud or a political smokescreen. In the late 1980s, the World Bank touted its loans to Communist nations as private sector-oriented loans - one bait-and-switch too many, as I detailed in a 1988 Wall Street Journal article. And permitting the Bank to exonerate its handouts by counting illusory jobs created is a recipe for make-work scams.\n\nThe Covid pandemic provided the World Bank with the chance to play savior. In the first months of the pandemic, the Bank proudly announced that its \"emergency operations to fight COVID-19 (coronavirus) have reached 100 developing countries - home to 70% of the world's population.\" From April 2020 to March 2021, the World Bank \"committed over $200 billion, an unprecedented level of financial support, to public and private sector clients to fight the impacts of the pandemic. Our support is tailored to the health, economic, and social shocks that countries are facing.\" The fact that the World Bank was effectively financing governments to pointlessly shock their own nations was omitted from celebratory press releases.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank have helped turn many foreign nations into kleptocracies - governments of thieves. A 2002 American Economic Review analysis concluded that \"increases in [foreign] aid are associated with contemporaneous increases in corruption,\" and that \"corruption is positively correlated with aid received from the United States.\"\n\nMost importantly, neither the IMF nor the World Bank has any qualms about bankrolling tyranny. A 2015 report of the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, concluded that the World Bank \"now stands almost alone, along with the International Monetary Fund, in insisting that human rights are matters of politics which it must, as a matter of legal principle, avoid, rather than being an integral part of the international legal order.\"\n\nThe Bank justifies this position by insisting that it cannot involve \"itself in the partisan politics or ideological disputes that affect its member countries\" by improper methods such as \"favoring political factions, parties or candidates in elections,\" or \"endorsing or mandating a particular form of government, political bloc or political ideology.\"\n\nBut any time an international organization financially bails out a regime, it bolsters its power. After the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon coined a term that perfectly captures the effect of foreign aid: \"Money as a Weapon System.\" The 2015 UN report noted that \"the existing approach taken by the World Bank to human rights is incoherent, counterproductive and unsustainable. For most purposes, the World Bank is a human rights-free zone. In its operational policies, in particular, it treats human rights more like an infectious disease than universal values and obligations.\"\n\nThe World Bank actively blindfolds itself to avoid hearing about atrocities in nations ruled by governments that it is bankrolling. The Special Rapporteur noted, \"By refusing to take account of any information emanating from human rights sources, the Bank places itself in an artificial bubble.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's lust for \"doubling down\" on the IMF and World Bank is dicey to reconcile with their terminating 90% of foreign aid contracts from the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Cynics across the land rejoiced that Washington policymakers finally recognized one of the biggest swindles of the past 80 years.\n\nIf the Trump team can't even get sound policy on the World Bank, then what hope is there of them resolving any more complex challenges? I was briefly a consultant for the World Bank in the late 1980s, getting paid to co-author a report on the follies of farm subsidies. At that point, Reagan administration officials had periodically caterwauled about the Bank for almost a decade, and they were followed by sporadic howling by the US Treasury Department ever since. Secretary Bessent complained on Wednesday that the World Bank \"should no longer expect blank checks for vapid, buzzword-centric marketing accompanied by halfhearted commitments to reform.\" But after almost a half-century of failed US attempts to reform the Bank and IMF, there is no reason to expect any boondoggles to be left behind.\n\nOr do Trump's appointees believe that laundering U.S. tax dollars through international entities somehow makes them beneficent? Or maybe US Treasury Department honchos want to make sure they continue to get invited to the most lavish parties in D.C. and around the world. Regardless, the IMF and World Bank financing the worst Covid policies around the globe is another reminder of why those entities should be axed.",

I'm Martin Farrer with some of the best overnight stories before Krishani Dhanji will take you through the last full day of campaigning.\n\nIt seems like political tensions have boiled over in some areas with New South Wales police launching multiple investigations in the last week into alleged violence, intimidation, harassment and antisocial behaviour related to the election. This has included the smearing of poo across a truck carrying an ad for the Liberal party. More coming up.\n\nA Liberal-aligned thinktank running last-minute anti-Greens advertisements targeting young voters received more than $600,000 from the coal industry during last year's Queensland election, disclosures show. At the same time, Labor and the Coalition have been accused of going to the election on a \"unity ticket\" to protect fossil fuels.\n\nIn what might well be the last poll before the one that really counts, Labor has a two-point lead over the Coalition on a two-party preferred basis. The Fin Review/Freshwater Strategy poll shows that Labor is on 51.5% to the Coalition's 48.5%. If replicated tomorrow that puts Labor on track for a minority government. More campaign reaction coming up.",

            "body": "Martin Scorsese will produce a new documentary featuring an on-camera interview with Pope Francis that was recorded at Vatican City in December, a few months before the pope died at the age of 88.\n\nThe film, \"Aldeas -- A New Story,\" is about the worldwide cultural project developed by Scholas Occurrentes, a global educational movement founded by Francis in 2013, the same year he was elected pope. Communities around the world will create scripts for short films that highlight their identities, histories and values.\n\nSnippets of the conversation between the pope and Scorsese will be interwoven into the film, which does not have a release date.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Scorsese said it was important to Francis for \"people across the globe to exchange ideas with respect while also preserving their cultural identity, and cinema is the best medium to do that.\" Before the pope's death, Francis called \"Aldeas\" a poetic project because it \"goes to the roots of what human life is.\"\n\nThe project punctuates a long relationship between the pope and Scorsese, whose work has sometimes been religious in nature. When \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" was released in 1988, it drew protests and outrage from religious groups.\n\nIn 2016, Scorsese met with Francis to discuss his movie \"Silence,\" a drama about a Portuguese Jesuit priest who heads to 17th-century Japan, where Christians are persecuted. They met again in 2023, when Scorsese announced he would make another film about Jesus. The director's most recent project, \"Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints,\" dramatizes the lives of eight Catholic saints.\n\nWhen Francis died, Scorsese said in a statement to Variety that he was lucky to have known him and that his loss for the world was immense.\n\n\"He had an ironclad commitment to the good,\" Scorsese said. \"He knew in his soul that ignorance was a terrible plague on humanity. So he never stopped learning. And he never stopped enlightening.\"",

            "title": "In Suits and Ties, Lawyers Protest Trump's Attacks on the Legal System",
            "body": "The National Law Day of Action, which drew roughly 1,500 people in New York City, was organized to resist the president's threats against judges and the nation's jurisprudence.\n\nThe crowd of protesters that packed Foley Square in downtown Manhattan on Thursday was as raucous as any demonstration in a politically vociferous city. It was, however, decidedly more wonky and dapper.\n\nAbout 1,500 demonstrators, many of them lawyers sporting business attire, jammed the plaza outside Manhattan's federal courthouse as part of the National Law Day of Action, chanting in favor of the rule of law and hoisting pocket Constitutions to the sky.\n\nIt was one of around 50 similar actions around the nation on Thursday, led by lawyers who say President Trump is threatening the foundation of America's legal system.\n\n\"The rule of law protects us all. Without it we will surely fall,\" the crowd chanted.\n\nIn his second term, Mr. Trump has aimed to hobble elite law firms, threatened to impeach judges and ignored their orders. For many inside the legal profession, his actions have presented an unpalatable choice between compromising their values by staying silent and facing professional risk by speaking out.\n\nNow, a growing number of lawyers see a moral imperative in choosing the latter option. They believe Mr. Trump's crusade is threatening not just their livelihoods, but a system to which they have devoted their lives. On Thursday, thousands of lawyers were expected to protest at federal courthouses in New York, Chicago and San Francisco -- roughly 50 cities in all.\n\nIn interviews, attendees of the event in New York pointed to a range of actions, including Mr. Trump's targeting of law firms he viewed as hostile, wrongful deportations and the arrest of a Wisconsin judge on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement.\n\n\"I'm horrified by what's going on,\" said James Kainen, 71, a law professor at Fordham University and a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. \"We had ethics. We prosecuted people because they violated the law, not because they angered somebody for some ridiculous reason.\"\n\nMr. Kainen held up a sign that said \"I want Perkins Coie as my law firm,\" referring to a firm that Mr. Trump has targeted with an executive order.\n\nOrganizers of the Foley Square rally instructed attendees to dress \"as if they were appearing in court,\" and encouraged them to carry pocket Constitutions.\n\n\"We want people to see that we treat this issue with utmost respect,\" said Ron Minkoff, a criminal defense lawyer and an organizer. \"This is like the courtroom to us.\"\n\nIt was not exactly a mass street protest. The jurists voiced their disapproval by ceremonially reaffirming their oath to upholding the rule of law. But the fact that lawyers are not famous for participating in demonstrations, organizers said, underscored the seriousness of the moment.\n\n\"If lawyers are taking to the streets, it means something very serious and bad is happening,\" said Traci Feit Love, the executive director of Lawyers for Good Government, a nonprofit that helped coordinate the events.\n\nThe administration's wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Mr. Trump's threats against judges were motivations for the day of action, but the president's targeting of elite law firms was a particular focus for some. Mr. Trump has unleashed a flurry of executive orders aimed at crippling firms he says have used the justice system against him. The orders have limited the firms' access to federal buildings and canceled their government contracts.\n\nTrump Administration: Live Updates\n\nUpdated\n\nMay 1, 2025, 3:34 p.m. ET55 minutes ago\n\nHawaii announced a climate lawsuit. So the government sued Hawaii first.New videos aim to persuade Chinese nationals to spy for the C.I.A.A Texas judge strikes down Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans.\n\nIn March, some of those firms started cutting deals, pledging pro bono legal support for Mr. Trump's causes in exchange for relief from his executive actions. Angered by the capitulations, organizations such as the New York County Lawyers Association and the New York Civil Liberties Union started discussing ways to stand up for what they saw as an assault on their profession.\n\n\"We're deeply concerned about the response of some of the major law firms,\" said Dawn Cardi, a defense lawyer who also helped organize the event in New York. \"It feels a little bit like I imagine it felt in the McCarthy era.\"\n\nSince the event was first envisioned, a growing number of firms have fought back, calling Mr. Trump's actions unconstitutional. Even the firms that have capitulated have seen internal dissent.\n\nLast week, lawyers for Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, both targeted by Mr. Trump, asked the courts to permanently block the orders. Hundreds of firms have signed briefs backing Perkins Coie. Last week, a federal judge stopped Mr. Trump from targeting the firm Susman Godfrey, calling it \"a shocking abuse of power.\"\n\nJ.B. Howard, a counsel in global litigation at Cadwalader, resigned after his firm made a deal with Mr. Trump.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Howard, 61, stressed that he was not angry at his firm for its decision. But he said he feared the consequences for his profession, and worried about the example he would set for his son, a law student, if he continued to work for a firm that had capitulated to Mr. Trump.\n\n\"I just can't be a practicing lawyer feeling as though I have abandoned a sacred obligation,\" Mr. Howard said. On Thursday, he attended a Law Day event in Denver, where he, along with more than 100 lawyers, entered the federal courthouse and retook their oaths.\n\nMore junior lawyers and law students have been outspoken about their outrage, even as they acknowledge the professional risks.\n\nHope Elizabeth Guzzle, a first-year law student at Fordham who attended the rally in New York, said the Trump administration's attack on legal norms had helped convince her to pursue a career in public interest law, rather than corporate law.\n\n\"The one place where there is still concern for norms and fighting back is in the law,\" said Ms. Guzzle, 24, who wore courtroom attire and held a sign that said \"Why am I even studying for my Con Law exam?\"\n\nA group of Georgetown University law students has created a spreadsheet of firms that color-codes them by whether they've capitulated to Mr. Trump, an effort first reported by the site All Rise News. In April, three anonymous law students filed suit against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, asking a federal court to bar firms from handing over sensitive information about employees to the administration.\n\nOn Tuesday, more than 1,000 law students filed an amicus brief supporting Susman Godfrey in its fight against Mr. Trump. Sam Haddad, a second-year law student at Yale Law School who signed the brief, said the Trump administration's attack on the rule of law -- and how many big firms had cut deals -- had given him pause about his career path.\n\n\"I now understand that legal professionals can hesitate, or worse, capitulate when the crisis is clear and the need to respond is unambiguous,\" Mr. Haddad, who worked at Susman as a fellow last summer, said in an interview.\n\nMr. Howard said that the firms' decisions would cost them in the fullness of time.\n\n\"These firms that are capitulating are kind of toxic to young lawyers and the next generation of lawyers,\" he said.",

            "title": "Logging devastated Victoria's native forests - and new research shows 20% has failed to grow back",
            "body": "Following the end of native logging in Victoria on January 1 2024, the state's majestic forests might be expected to regenerate and recover naturally. But our new research shows that's not always the case.\n\nWe quantified the extent of regeneration following logging in the eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia between 1980 and 2019. This included nearly 42,000 hectares of logged mountain ash forest in Victoria's Central Highlands.\n\nWe analysed satellite data, logging records, on-ground surveys and drone photography, and discovered that nearly 20% of logged areas failed to regenerate. This represents more than 8,000 hectares of forest lost. All that remains in these areas are grassy clearings, dense shrublands or bare soils.\n\nWe also found the rate of regeneration failure has increased over the past decade. While failure was rare in the 1980s, it became much more common over time - affecting more than 80% of logged sites by 2019.\n\nThese regeneration failures weren't random. They were found mostly in close proximity to each other, on areas with steep slopes, relatively low elevation, and where the area of clear-felled forest was long and narrow.\n\nOur research shows more needs to be done to restore Victoria's forest after logging.\n\nRestoring majestic forests and their vital services\n\nVictoria is home to some of the most spectacular forests on the planet. They include extensive stands of mountain ash, the tallest flowering plant on Earth, which can grow to almost 100 metres in height. Alpine ash, another giant, can grow up to 60m tall.\n\nThese forests have great cultural significance to Indigenous people and support many recreational and tourism activities.\n\nHealthy forest ecosystems also deliver clean water and carbon storage services. In fact, mountain ash forests contain more carbon per hectare than most other forests around the world.\n\nBut Victoria's forests have long been logged for timber and pulp. The main method of logging - clearfelling - scars the landscape, leaving large areas devoid of trees if natural tree regeneration fails.\n\nMountain ash is especially vulnerable\n\nOur research revealed 19.2% of areas logged between 1980 and 2019 in our study area (8,030ha out of 41,819ha cut) failed to regenerate naturally.\n\nWe also found strong evidence of a significant increase in the extent of failed regeneration over 40 years, increasing from less than two hectares per cutblock in 1980 (about 7.5%) to more than nine hectares per cutblock in 2019 (about 85%), on average.\n\nWe found regeneration failure was more likely in mountain ash forests compared with other forest types.\n\nThis adds to the case for listing the mountain ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria as a threatened ecological community.\n\nA responsibility to restore\n\nUnder Victoria's Code of Forest Practice for Timber Production, logged native forests must be properly regenerated within two to three years of harvest.\n\nThat's because it is nearly impossible for the native forest to regenerate after three years without human intervention. The young trees face too much competition from grass and shrubs.\n\nThese degraded areas no longer hold the value they once did and they cannot provide the same level of ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water purification, or habitat for wildlife.\n\nWith no current government restoration plan, these landscapes will remain degraded indefinitely. The Victorian government retains legal responsibility to restore these degraded forests, but currently lacks any large-scale restoration strategy, making action urgently required.\n\nA way forward: using green bonds to fund regeneration\n\nOur research shows the regeneration of forests after logging is not guaranteed. Nature often needs a helping hand. But we need to find ways to fund these projects.\n\nGlobally, governments have used \"green bonds\" to lower the cost of borrowing tied explicitly to measurable environmental results.\n\nVictoria already has green bonds \"to finance new and existing projects that offer climate change and environmental benefits\". But funds are typically used to finance investments in transport, renewable energy, water and low carbon buildings.\n\nAs part of a coalition of researchers, environmental organisations, and finance sector partners we proposed a A$224 million green bond for forest regeneration. This proposal was put to the Victorian government via the Treasury Corporation of Victoria.\n\nGreen bond funding would help leverage co-investment from the Commonwealth government and philanthropic partners to improve monitoring and biodiversity outcomes in native forests.\n\nAs part of the proposed green bond, areas of logged forest where natural regeneration has failed would be restored.\n\nOther investments under the green bond could include creating tourism ventures (and associated jobs), controlling feral animals such as deer, and biodiversity recovery - creating habitat for endangered species such as the southern greater glider and Leadbeater's possum, for example.\n\nThe $224 million required for the ten years of the green bond -- or around $22.4 million per year -- is less than the substantial losses Victoria incurred on its investment in VicForests over the past decade.\n\nOur research suggests leaving nature to its own devices would mean losing a fifth of the forests logged over the past 40 years. Bringing the trees back has multiple benefits and would be well worth the investment.",

            "body": "Want to stay updated on what's happening in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip? Sign up for Your Places: Global Update, and we'll send our latest coverage to your inbox.\n\nA top Trump appointee in the Justice Department ordered an aggressive investigation in the last several months of student protesters at Columbia University, raising anger and alarm among career prosecutors and investigators who saw the demand as politically motivated and lacking legal merit, people familiar with the episode said.\n\nThe demand for the inquiry into students who protested Israel's conduct of the conflict in Gaza also prompted pushback from a federal magistrate judge, who believed some of the steps being sought by the official were unjustified and might violate the First Amendment, the people said.\n\nThe breadth of the investigation, conducted by the Justice Department's civil rights division, has not been previously reported. The ensuing clash highlights the tensions roiling the department as administration officials seek to enact President Trump's agenda, including redirecting the civil rights division away from its traditional approach of protecting the rights of minority groups with a new mission to fulfill a campaign promise by cracking down on student protesters amid accusations of rampant antisemitism on college campuses.\n\nThose types of demands from political appointees at the Justice Department are part of the reason there has been an exodus of lawyers from the division in recent weeks, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe federal investigation into student protesters at Columbia appears to have stalled for now, but it represents one of the most contentious episodes yet inside the Justice Department during Mr. Trump's second term. The dispute has left lingering ill will within the department, as well as the courts and the F.B.I., the people said.\n\nAsked for comment, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said, \"This is a false story fabricated by a group of people who allowed antisemitism and support of Hamas terrorists to fester for several years, standing by but doing nothing.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has vowed to take on campus protests against Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip, saying they reflect antisemitism that must be punished. Those efforts are aimed at both college administrators, who Trump officials say should have done more to rein in campus protests, and student activists themselves, some of whom immigration officials have detained. Activists, in turn, accuse the authorities of conflating criticism of Israeli and U.S. policy with antisemitism.\n\nJustice Dept.'s Criminal Inquiry of Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms Internally - The New York Times\n\nThe investigation began shortly after masked protesters barged into Milbank Hall, a building at Barnard College, on Feb. 26 to demonstrate against the expulsion of students who had been accused of disrupting a \"History of Modern Israel\" class. Video shows students pushing past a security guard and occupying a hallway. School officials said at the time that the guard was assaulted and taken to the hospital for minor injuries.\n\nEmil Bove III, a senior Justice Department official, ordered an immediate investigation, primarily of one particular student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details intended to remain private.\n\nProdded by Mr. Bove, prosecutors in the civil rights division were told to obtain a membership list of the group. Investigators, however, pushed back on those instructions because they were skeptical such a list even existed, given the amorphous nature of online forums, and even if it did, scrutinizing people for their membership seemed like a possible violation of their First Amendment rights, these people said.\n\nOne of the Justice Department lawyers assigned to the case was Samantha Trepel, an experienced civil rights prosecutor who secured a federal conviction against Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd in 2020, these people said.\n\nThe prosecutors were told by superiors that Mr. Bove was seeking a list so the information could be shared with immigration agents, these people said. Inside the civil rights division, prosecutors came to fear that their criminal investigation was a pretext to facilitate an intimidation and deportation campaign by the Trump administration against student protesters, these people said. Prosecutors refused to compile such a list that could be given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, these people said.\n\nMr. Bove then shifted his focus to obtaining a search warrant for the group's Instagram account, these people said. He ordered prosecutors to apply for a search warrant for the nonpublic data associated with the account, these people said.\n\nThe premise of the application was also contentious within the department. Mr. Bove insisted that the Instagram account in question had been used to make a threat, while line prosecutors said the statement at issue did not meet the legal definition of a threat, these people said. In late March, the social media company suspended the group's account for failing to meet its \"community standards.\"\n\nMr. Blanche, in his statement, added that the warrant application focused on Columbia University Apartheid Divest \"included a photograph from C.U.A.D.'s social media of an inverted triangle symbol used by Hamas to designate targets for violence, which was spray-painted on Columbia property along with red paint designed to look like blood.\"\n\nHe said the investigation was \"ongoing,\" appearing to point to a related criminal investigation that the federal authorities have pursued, one that \"included an independent magistrate judge finding probable cause to believe that there was evidence on Columbia property of harboring and concealing illegal aliens.\"\n\nBefore Mr. Trump delivered a speech to the Justice Department on March 14, Mr. Blanche told the audience that the department was investigating whether anyone involved in the campus protests at Columbia violated civil rights laws and antiterrorism laws.\n\nMr. Blanche projected unwavering certainty about the wisdom of such an investigation. But behind the scenes, career lawyers had profound doubts about the merits of the case they were assigned, and deep concerns about the potential consequences if they refused.\n\nMr. Bove's demands frustrated people in the civil rights division, but many of the managers were afraid to push back, having watched a month earlier as Mr. Bove pressed prosecutors in a different division, the public integrity section, to drop criminal charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York, the three people said. That section, which once had about 30 lawyers, now has only a handful.\n\nBennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor who specializes in prosecutorial ethics, said the described conduct of Mr. Bove was \"staggering.\"\n\n\"He did something that prosecutors are absolutely forbidden to do -- use the law enforcement powers of the government to try to intimidate these individuals or destroy their rights,\" Mr. Gershman said. \"This is so far past the line of prosecutorial professionalism and the commitment to principles of justice.\"\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Blanche said that \"unethical and inaccurate claims from deep state terrorist sympathizers who stood by as members of the Jewish faith were targeted across the country\" would not deter Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and the Justice Department from \"aggressively investigating criminal conduct and rooting out antisemitism.\"\n\nWhen the federal prosecutors involved in the investigation of student protesters applied for a search warrant, a magistrate judge in New York rejected the request, finding that the government did not have sufficient probable cause, these people said.\n\nIn an unusual move, Mr. Bove insisted that the prosecutors appeal the ruling to a district court judge, these people said. After weighing the request, Judge John G. Koeltl of Federal District Court of the Southern District of New York instructed the chief magistrate judge, Sarah Netburn, to reconsider the application, the people said.\n\nBut the second time, the government lawyers fared even worse. Judge Netburn not only rejected the request for a search warrant, but she also ordered the government to abide by a special condition: Should prosecutors ever try to refile such an application before another federal judge, they had to include a transcript of the sealed discussions in her court, these people said.\n\nPart of the judge's skepticism, these people said, stemmed from the absence from the case of lawyers with the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office. But prosecutors in the Southern District of New York were wary of signing onto the effort and had minimal involvement with it, these people said. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.\n\nWhile civil rights prosecutors conducted the investigation that Mr. Bove had demanded, they often pushed back against specific steps that he wanted taken, these people said, arguing that they were either not justified by the available facts or contrary to law and past practice, or both.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Bove instructed F.B.I. agents on the joint terrorism task force in New York to put on their raid jackets, go to Columbia's campus and stand in a phalanx near any protesters. Within the civil rights division, the instruction was viewed as deeply improper and a blatant attempt to intimidate students, these people said. The F.B.I. agents did not make any such show of force.\n\nBy early April, the investigation seemed to have largely died, but nothing prevents Mr. Bove or others from reviving it. In its wake, however, people familiar with the case said it had only exacerbated the ill will and distrust between political appointees at the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington and the prosecutor's office in New York, as well as between those political appointees and veterans of the civil rights division.",

            "title": "The Greens say land-based salmon farming is viable. The Tasmanian industry says otherwise",
            "body": "Tasmania's salmon industry -- a $1.3 billion operation concentrated mostly in the state's south -- has become a contentious political topic this federal election campaign.\n\nIt produced almost 75,000 tonnes of Atlantic salmon in the 2022-23 financial year, and those in support of the industry argue it's an important economic contributor to the state, while providing employment to regional communities.\n\nThe industry, made up of three foreign-owned companies -- Tassal, Huon and Petuna -- has recently found itself at the centre of several environmental incidents, and has played a key role in a last-minute law change by Anthony Albanese's Labor government.\n\nNot long after, video released of live salmon being placed into bins with dead fish resulted in Huon losing its RSPCA certification.\n\nThe industry has been criticised by conservation and environmental groups for years over its impact on the endangered Maugean skate, a ray-like fish found only in Macquarie Harbour.\n\nTo mitigate the impacts to marine areas, environmental groups such as Neighbours of Fish Farming (NOFF) have argued that commercially-farmed salmon could be moved to land-based operations.\n\nThey say land-based farming also minimises the spread of disease, reducing the need for antibiotics, and removes noise and light pollution for coastal communities.\n\nIt's a strategy the salmon industry strongly opposes, arguing the move to 100 per cent land-based farming would be economically, logistically and politically unrealistic.\n\nThe push to land-based salmon farming\n\nIn Tasmania, commercially grown salmon starts in freshwater land-based hatcheries, before being moved to saltwater open-pen farms on maturity.\n\nLand-based farming uses Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), a controlled environment that reuses water and limits the movement of fish.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tasmanian Greens Senator Nick McKim announced a new policy to force salmon farms out of the state's coastal waters and in to land-based farms.\n\nThe Greens' proposal includes $50 million of Commonwealth funding for environmental remediation, independent monitoring of salmon farms for compliance with animal cruelty and environmental standards, and a \"jobs transition package\" for Macquarie Harbour workers.\n\nUnder the policy, the salmon industry would self-fund its transition to land-based farming.\n\nThe Greens have not put a timeline on the completion of the transition.\n\nTasmania's salmon industry is regulated by the state government.\n\nMr McKim said there were \"plenty of levers that can be pulled\" at a state level to instigate the transition.\n\n\"There's no doubt that the powers exist to transition the industry on shore and to force it to transition on shore,\" he said.\n\nThe Tasmanian government has not supported the Greens' policy.\n\nIndependent federal candidate for Franklin and Climate-200-backed anti-salmon campaigner, Peter George, has also flagged land-based aquaculture as an environmentally positive alternative.\n\nMr George took leave from his role as NOFF's president to challenge federal Fisheries Minister Julie Collins in the federal election.\n\nWhy the Tasmanian industry says it can't work\n\nLuke Martin, outgoing chief executive of the industry's peak body Salmon Tasmania, dismissed the case for 100-per-cent land-based farming as \"voodoo economics\".\n\n\"It will never get to a point where you do the entire production period, the entire two-year life cycle of the fish, on land,\" Mr Martin said.\n\nHe said large amounts of water, energy and land would be required to transition the industry, requirements he deemed unfeasible.\n\nMr Martin also argued that the cost of moving the industry to land-based farms was significant and would drive up the price of the product, making it economically unviable.\n\n\"We're talking about giant artificial ponds, enormous tanks built into the Tasmanian landscape -- which community would be lining up to put their hand up in Tasmania?\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said the industry was investigating how it could expand the amount of time fish spend on land before being transferred to marine pens -- with an eye to expanding operations.\n\n\"And then secure leases in deeper water, into more open water areas like outer Storm Bay, potentially off the coast.\"\n\nMr Martin said if land-based farming did become feasible, he believed the industry would move closer to bigger mainland markets to minimise costs.\n\nHas it worked elsewhere?\n\nOther commercially grown finfish, such as barramundi, are farmed at land-based facilities in Queensland and the Northern Territory at far smaller volumes than Atlantic salmon.\n\nInternationally, most industrial-scale salmon farming takes place in open-net pens out on the water.\n\nHowever, land-based commercial Atlantic salmon farms do exist, and have been implemented at small scale in many countries -- most notably in the US, Canada, Japan and Europe.\n\nThe scale of production at these land-based locations is far smaller than their ocean counterparts.\n\nThe largest example of land-based RAS aquaculture is Florida-based company, Atlantic Sapphire, which raises salmon in a \"bluehouse\", a climate-controlled indoor facility that minimises the risk of disease and environmental contamination.\n\nBut profitability remains a challenge.\n\nIn 2023, the company harvested just over 1,500 tonnes, a decrease of about 700 tonnes from the previous year.\n\nCanada is the world's fourth-largest producer of Atlantic salmon, with the majority of its industry farming in west coast waters off Vancouver Island in British Columbia.\n\nIt is attempting to transition part of its billion-dollar industry to land-based practices.\n\nIn June last year, the Canadian government promised to ban marine salmon farming in British Columbia by 2029, citing environmental concerns and the need to protect wild salmon populations.\n\nThe plan has left the region's peak-industry body, the British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association, concerned and doubtful it can be achieved without significant job losses.\n\nIts executive director, Brian Kingzett, told the ABC the estimated cost to transition the industry was more than 2 billion Canadian dollars.\n\n\"Much like Tasmania, we're largely a remote island. Our salmon farms are in rural areas, we don't have the power grid or the land to support on-land aquaculture.\"",

            "body": "The Duke of Sussex has well and truly flipped the script and is trying something completely new this year, leaving many agahst.\n\nWe love a mystery. A gone girl, a podcast, a true crime investigation, which is handy because we are faced with a Sherlockian puzzler that will require a magnifying glass and everyone bringing a packed lunch to try and solve.\n\nHave you noticed? Something strange and unusual of late? Something missing? A certain silence, a space, a void? A one time super glued-on fixture of news headlines, a mainstay of People covers and all round general thorn in the side of the British royal family?\n\nSo far, 2025 has to be the quietest year on record for the 40-year-old who appears to have vanished into the honeysuckled thin air of Montecito.\n\nThe royal father-of-two has, this year, seem to have become something of a comparative recluse, keeping his head firmly down.\n\nThere have been no denunciations of the press in interviews or speeches given on New York stages where, dark blue-suited, he passionately rails against the ills of social media or him, tan-blazered, raising funds for his mainstay charities.\n\nDitto, no polo, no red carpets, no TV projects, no books, no podcasts, no beachy holidays, no Katy Perry concerts, no private jets, no drinks at Ellen's place and no even being papped leaving a local Santa Barbara restaurant after putting away a T-bone.\n\nWe are living in a very strange Sussex-y time indeed.\n\nBy and large this year, the vast majority of the times the duke has been seen, it has been being one half of a double act with his wife Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex. In January the couple found themselves, wholly unfairly, at the centre of a bit of a s**tstorm after they turned up to lend a hand during the LA fires before Harry, very much on the down low, occasionally popped up to thank first responders.\n\nHe also made a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance at One805's Rock for Responders\n\nfundraiser in LA.\n\nIn February, for one week, it was High Wattage Harry A-Go-Go at the Invictus Games in Vancouver.\n\nIn March he earned himself not even an IMDB credit with a cameo in the final episode of his wife's generally critically panned With Love, Meghan playing his favourite role, beamingly adoring husband.\n\nIn April he flew to London to attend court where he is legally challenging what is technically his father's government over his security arrangements, having lost his automatic police protection in 2020.\n\nLast week, we got another chance to really prove he's the world's proudest Wife Guy when he played supportive plus one when the duchess spoke at the TIME100 Summit in New York.\n\nAlso during that trip, the Sussexes unveiled the Lost Screen Memorial which remembers 50 young people who have lost their lives due to harms of social media.\n\nHarry, as far as I can tell, has not done a day of publicly facing paid work. Despite being the Chief Impact Officer of coaching platform BetterUp he did not appear at their recent Uplift Summit, an event he spoke at for the previous four years.\n\nWe are at least 120 days into 2025 so far and Harry has been seen on fewer of them than there have been UFO sightings in New Jersey. (Because where else would the alien invasion begin but in the birthplace of disco fries and Danny DeVito?)\n\nNever has there been a time in the last two decades, by and large, that the world has seen so little of the Duke of Sussex.\n\nHas Harry, I wonder, pulled off something truly extraordinary - by and large is this the shockingly quiet, peaceful life he always dreamed about? Where he can do Dad things like pickups and drop offs and where no one is busy defining him as the Boy Who Will Never Be King?\n\nAfter all, he has told his story, cashed the cheques and, maybe, given up on expectantly waiting by the phone for his father King Charles to stutter out some sort of half-hearted 'sorry' over the yapping of the Jack Russells.\n\nThat's one view. Another is that, five years on from Megxit, the Duke of Sussex's life has ended up in something of a cul-de-sac.\n\nLast month he revealed he was 'heartbroken' to have parted ways with Sentebale, the charity that he and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho co-founded nearly 20 years ago, the duo along with the rest of the trustees having resigned in protest over chairwoman Dr Sophie Chandauka. Dr Chandauka has accused Harry and the organisation of \"bullying and harassment at scale\".\n\nThe UK's Charity Commission is currently investigating concerns about the Sentebale.\n\nI'm absolutely sure that Harry does a hell of a lot of work behind the scenes for the Invictus and the Sussexes' Archewell Foundation's projects, we are a hell of long way off the 152 engagements, at least, that he clocked up in his final full year of official royal life in 2019.\n\nThe interesting contrast here is that Harry appears to have withdrawn from view while Meghan is more out there and in the limiest of lights, appearing on podcasts (her own and a friend's), being interviewed by the New York Times, debuting her Netflix show, launching her As Ever range of food products and posting, posting, posting over on Instagram.\n\nAs anyone who lives near a fault line knows, the thing to do in an earthquake is \"duck and cover\". Who knew he would seemingly take it so very literally?",

Chuck Schumer's \"very strongly worded\" letter that he sent to President Trump demanding answers on Harvard's federal funding freeze - taking a sarcastic jab at the supposedly tough, \"shake in your boots\" missive.\n\nDuring an appearance Wednesday on \"The Late Show,\" the former White House press secretary warned that if Democrats keep using washed-up strategies instead of fighting back, they'll lose another election.\n\n\"But Chuck Schumer, he wrote a very strongly worded letter,\" host Stephen Colbert joked.\n\n\"With eight strongly worded questions,\" Psaki chimed in.\n\nColbert added, \"What more could you ask of a leader?\"\n\n\"If that's not going to make you shake in your boots, I don't know what is,\" Psaki continued.\n\nShe's just the latest to ridicule Schumer's tactic, last week sending a letter, along with four other Jewish senators, demanding Trump immediately reverse course on his attacks against Harvard.\n\nThe federal government has frozen more than $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the university over pro-Palestinian campus protests.\n\nPsaki argued that Democratic lawmakers need to take a more aggressive approach to their GOP counterparts.\n\n\"Go lead a protest. Go to a red state. Go hold a town hall. Go to El Salvador, whatever it may be,\" Psaki said on the late-night show.\n\n\"People want to know you're fighting and doing things. If Democrats are going to rely on the tactics of old, they will lose, and so hopefully more people come onto the fighting side,\" she continued.\n\nShe nodded to Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, who over the weekend called for \"mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption.\"\n\n\"It was incredibly powerful, incredibly strong,\" Psaki said. \"The message he was sending was, 'I'm a fighter.

            "title": "Wikipedia Editors Melt Down over U.S. Attorney Ed Martin Accusing Site of Political Bias",
            "body": "After Acting U.S. Attorney for D.C. Ed Martin sent a letter last week to the foundation that owns Wikipedia raising questions regarding the online encyclopedia's political bias, editors made repeated attacks against Martin on the site. Editors also attacked Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger and Elon Musk due to their criticism of the site's left-wing bias.\n\nSome editors suggested Wikipedia respond to the letter by imposing a temporary blackout of the site as happened when protesting copyright laws they deemed too restrictive. Others suggested moving the site's servers or the Wikimedia Foundation itself outside the United States.\n\nMartin's letter cited concerns about Wikipedia's political bias and foreign actors pushing propaganda. Discussion of Martin's letter began at the discussion page for Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. Although Wales has lost many of his privileges on Wikipedia, he remains a member of the Foundation's board of trustees. Multiple editors, including an admin who was formerly part of the site's Arbitration Committee akin to a Supreme Court, suggested the site's Foundation owners say \"fuck off\" or \"fuck off Nazi\" as their official response.\n\nCriticism also focused on Martin's requests to the Foundation showing a misunderstanding of the group's role in governing Wikipedia. However, while the Foundation largely avoided interfering with the community previously, in recent years it has imposed a left-wing \"code of conduct\" on all Foundation-owned sites like Wikipedia, though enforcement is largely delegated to volunteers. Prior attempts at more direct enforcement of policy have prompted editor revolts. Although there were also suggestions Martin raised legitimate concerns, many editors insisted Martin's concerns were not genuine and his objection was \"facts\" on Wikipedia contradicted his and the Trump Administration's views with their intention being to intimidate and co-opt the site.\n\nEditors in a wider community discussion launched into attacks on Martin. Administrator \"Voorts\" called Martin a \"clown\" in a hostile rant. Several editors followed up by making other attacks with administrator \"Llywrch\" claiming \"those around the short-fingered convicted felon\" were either clowns or incompetent hacks along with other incendiary political statements. Yet another editor responded to this stating they, including Martin, were \"killer clowns\" and \"literally supporting more than one genocide\" at the moment. Editor \"Cambalachero\" commented in the middle of this discussion to note that Wikipedia's policies on claims about living people still apply in the discussion, though none of the editors modified their remarks.\n\nAdministrator \"Bishonen\" wryly suggested creating a Wikipedia article about the letter itself. Her comments unfavorably referenced an Indian court case against the Foundation and how an article created about the court case had to be pulled down on the order of the court, while suggesting an article about Martin's letter would more likely stay up. Bishonen has previously used her privileges to favor left-wing editors on the violent far-left Antifa group and the GamerGate anti-corruption movement in gaming.\n\nMartin's Wikipedia page was also vandalized shortly after the letter's release by non-account users calling him a \"Nazi\" and a \"cuckold\" with another labeling him \"far-right\" repeatedly before an admin, a user with special privileges, locked the page so only registered accounts over a few days old with multiple edits could edit. However, the \"far-right\" label was soon added back by an admitted Trump critic who added a paragraph labeling Martin a \"conspiracy theorist\" citing blogs and opinion pieces, despite such sourcing violating policy and the label was also added to the first sentence of Martin's article.\n\nOne editor added negative material about Martin's involvement in a leadership battle over the conservative Eagle Forum founded by Phyllis Schlafly, without noting any material from the source describing members of the Schlafly family supporting Martin's position and defending his conduct. Another editor added a line to the first paragraph of the article stating Martin \"has a history of making incendiary claims about opponents and causing ethical and legal controversies\" citing a single ProPublica article, which itself sourced its statement to a piece at left-wing Media Matters.\n\nWhen an editor attempted to remove several labels attacking Martin from the first paragraph of his page, editor Paul Lee, who edits as \"Valjean\" on Wikipedia and is an obsessively anti-Trump editor, restored them. Administrator \"Zzuzz\" later removed the \"conspiracy theorist\" label, but the \"far-right\" label was restored by Bishonen after another editor removed that label citing a paragraph that had exactly one source using the label. Site policy is that articles on people should avoid contentious terms in the first sentence in favor of those widely used in sources deemed reliable on Wikipedia.\n\nSite co-founder Larry Sanger also was targeted as a result of the opening post in the community discussion stating he was \"involved\" in the letter. Sanger was merely mentioned for his criticisms of Wikipedia, but several editors attacked Sanger as complicit in Martin's letter with one editor calling him extreme and dismissing as \"ridiculous\" his criticisms of the site's left-wing bias. Previously, Sanger has been smeared by Wikipedia editors over his criticism of the site.\n\nMultiple editors suggested there was some credibility to the criticism or concern in the discussion, but this often received a hostile response from other editors. When Cambalachero suggested responding seriously to Martin, another editor insisted the letter was \"intimidation by a government that does not like press freedom, free speech, academic liberty, sciences, and more broadly knowledge.\"\n\nCambalachero criticized the suggestion of there being a conspiracy to silence Wikipedia, but several editors objected with one arguing Musk along with others were trying to silence Wikipedia, though deferred on whether it was a conspiracy. Editor Andy Mabbett insisted a conspiracy existed with Musk specifically identified as involved along with the Heritage Foundation. As evidence against Musk, he merely cited an article about Musk criticizing Wikipedia for negatively-slanted edits about him and general issues of political bias. Mabbett has served as a \"Wikipedian in Residence\" at numerous research institutions and universities and organized various editing events at others.\n\nRegarding the Heritage Foundation, which has been alleged to be looking to uncover the real identities of editors engaged in antisemitic editing, Cambalachero said its goal was sympathetic. However, several editors objected that it was not about antisemitism with editor \"Viriditas\" insisting Republicans do not care about Jews and comparing Jews who support Republicans to \"kapos in Nazi-era WWII who helped their fellow Jews to their deaths\" in concentration camps.\n\n\"North8000\" suggested they \"create and publicize initiatives to find systemic fixes\" to Wikipedia's bias on politics to address criticism. Some editors were sympathetic to the suggestion, but editor \"Simonm223\" criticized the idea by claiming \"the far-right\" wants Wikipedia's \"submission\" rather than neutrality. He further argued Wikipedia has a \"center-right\" bias, a claim previously used by the main Wikipedia community newsletter to dismiss left-wing bias claims, and that a \"neutral encyclopedia would be more critical of the Trump regime\" than Wikipedia is now. Simonm223 is a self-identified socialist that previously praised an Antifa terrorist who attacked an ICE detention facility during Trump's first term.\n\nSome editors in the discussion suggested counter-measures to evade any legal response by Martin such as moving the Wikipedia servers or the Foundation itself to another country, though many editors raised concern about which countries would allow them the same degree of freedom they currently enjoy. Other editors suggested decentralizing the site's fundraising efforts across multiple countries. Wales expressed his view in the discussion that pressure from the United States was not a serious vulnerability.\n\nVictor Grigas, a former Wikimedia Foundation staffer, suggested a \"blackout\" of the site as a protest similar to actions taken in response to copyright laws editors deemed too restrictive, though other editors were resistant. When an editor in that discussion suggested the Foundation might take steps to comply with Martin's concerns and \"threaten Wikipedia freedomness and neutral point of view\" in the process, Wales responded by rejecting the idea and referred to Martin's letter as an attack arguing \"when being attacked, one of the thing that the attackers usually want is for the attackees to turn on each other for no reason. We can be unified because we are unified.\"\n\nWikipedia has come under increasing scrutiny due to its apparent left-wing bias as identified in numerous studies. Part of the scrutiny has focused on the online encyclopedia's sourcing policies and its purging of conservative media. The site has been increasingly relied on by Big Tech platforms and praised by corporate media who have even copied its contents as with Wikipedia's extremely biased article on GamerGate. Such reliance comes in spite of Wikipedia's long history of spreading hoaxes and issues with paid editing. The Wikimedia Foundation's promotion of Wikipedia as a solution to \"fake news\" came after the firm run by the Clinton Foundation's Communications leader suggested the strategy.\n\n(Disclosure: The author has previously been involved in disputes on Wikipedia with some parties referenced in this article)",

            "body": "This week in Newly Reviewed, Holland Cotter covers Sheyla Baykal's downtown stars, a group show from a radical feminist art collective and Young Joon Kwak's quieter side.\n\nSheyla Baykal\n\nThrough May 10. Soft Network, 636 Broadway; 917-803-3620, softnetwork.art.\n\nIn the New York City art world in the 1960s, '70s and even early '80s, the descriptive terms \"downtown\" and \"underground\" were pretty much synonymous. The photographer Sheyla Baykal (1944-1997) was a vital inhabitant of that terrain, and one of its underrecognized visual historians.\n\nNow, largely thanks to the attention of another veteran avant-garde citizen -- the performance artist Penny Arcade, who has preserved Baykal's material legacy -- we have a thrilling view into those decades in an exhibition at Soft Network, a gallery devoted to preserving artists' estates.\n\nBorn in the United States and raised in Turkey, Baykal was herself a sought-after photographic subject as a Ford agency fashion model in the 1960s. But she also carried a camera of her own and had it trained on the New York's art scene. Through a family connection she had entree into the Abstract Expressionist circles of an earlier day; Willem and Elaine de Kooning, well along in years, were among her subjects.\n\nHer focus, though, was a new, venturesome, primarily gay world of performance-intensive art, and her photos give us an archival treasury of images. She documented the extravagant theatrics of West Coast hippie drag collectives like the Cockettes and the Angels of Light, and the New York performer and filmmaker Jack Smith.\n\nBaykal eventually came to favor portraiture as a genre. And some of the most radical talents associated with Manhattan's pre-gentrified East Village scene sat for her: Bette Bourne of Bloolips fame; the performance-art dream team of Ethyl Eichelberger and Agosto Machado; the genius installation artist Paul Thek; and the photographer laureate of the underground, Peter Hujar (his ineffable 1976 book, \"Portraits in Life and Death,\" has recently been republished by Liveright).\n\nAIDS and age have taken most of these beings from us, but they all appear in the Soft Network exhibition of Baykal photographs, videos and ephemera organized by the art historian Marcelo Gabriel Y\u00e1\u00f1ez with Penny Arcade. And at a time when, by presidential order, all things L.G.B.T.Q. are being officially whited out from the record, Baykal and her subjects glow like the art-firmamental stars they were, and are.\n\nNancy Brooks Brody, Joy Episalla, Zoe Leonard and Carrie Yamaoka\n\nThrough May 11. Participant, Inc., 116 Elizabeth Street; 646-492-4076, participantinc.org.\n\nThis small, grave, beautiful show brings together work by four of the founding members of Fierce Pussy, a radical lesbian feminist art collective. It also stands as a memorial to one of its members, the much-missed Nancy Brooks Brody, who died in 2023.\n\nThe collective emerged in 1991 as an offshoot of the activist group ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). It focused attention particularly on the effects of the AIDS epidemic on women, and did so through the production of street-level, no-budget forms of protest art like wheat-pasted posters and guerrilla-style actions.\n\nThe Participant exhibition, organized by Jo-ey Tang, begins with a reminder of this history at the gallery entrance, with a stack of takeaway posters emblazoned with the phrase \"I got all my sisters with me\" (a quote from the 1979 Sister Sledge song \"We Are Family\"). But the show itself is about the individual work of the four founding artists, much of which seems to be addressing the vulnerability of art itself, and particularly of art by queer women, in a hostile culture.\n\nZoe Leonard's photograph of a gnarled city tree pushing through fencing reads as a cleareyed, poetic study in struggle. So does a floor piece by Carrie Yamaoka composed of fabric remnants of a ruined couch or bed, but with all the textile fragments neatly folded so as to look precious, not abject, or maybe both. Similarly, Joy Episalla's large sculpture made of creased and crumpled photographic paper comes across both as fodder for a compactor and as a bold statement of anti-monumentalism.\n\nAnd a few modest-size works by Brody suggest why she is so missed. One, a black-and-white painting of wavy lines, carries the gritty title of \"Glory Hole\" but looks like an ethereal Agnes Martin grid shimmying and dancing. A sculpture consisting of two small triangular strips of black metal embedded high up in a gallery wall almost escapes detection but, once noticed, grips, the eye and mind: Is it meant to suggest a wound? An ornament? A surveillance device? It's a lesson in how, in the right hands, \"not much\" can fire questions in every direction and be absolutely, powerfully there.\n\nYoung Joon Kwak\n\nThrough July 27. Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, 26 Wooster Street; 212-431-2609, leslielohman.org.\n\nBorn in Queens in 1984 and now based in Los Angeles, the artist Young Joon Kwak, who is Korean American and transgender, covers a lot of ground media-wise. A sculptor and video artist, they co-founded an electronic-dance-noise band called Xina Xurner in 2011; they were, and are, the rousing lead singer. A year later, in Los Angeles, Kwak turned their studio into a communal space called the Mutant Salon, where queer, trans and femme-based projects could be developed.\n\nMuch of this work was visually and aurally raucous. But the Leslie-Lohman show -- organized by Stamatina Gregory, the museum's head curator -- is the opposite: spare, quiet. A large, seemingly abstract recent ceramic sculpture called \"Femmes (Nic, Toria, Tala)\" is a cast of the embracing bodies of three nonbinary friends. Another work, \"Veil (Lulu),\" is made from a pair of glitter-coated ceramic arms and hands open in a gesture of benedictory welcome. A third, \"Divine Ruin (Stamatina and Young),\" is in the form of what appears to be two overlapped faces encrusted with glistening rhinestones. All are images of joining, unity, community.\n\nAnother version of \"Divine Ruin,\" this one a self-portrait of the artist, is in an exhibition called \"The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture\" at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art in Washington. That show has been singled out for condemnation in one of the recent presidential executive orders that have accused cultural institutions of promoting divisive \"ideology\" around the subjects of gender and race.\n\nSo, in the spirit of timeliness, let me recommend three additional New York exhibitions that keep the spark of Resisterhood burning. The group show \"Ficciones Pat\u00f3genas,\" also at Leslie-Lohman, addresses the torturous history of Indigenous gender diversity under European colonialism in the Americas. For \"Deviations\" at James Fuentes, the artist Oscar yi Hou has assembled, pretty much on the fly, a survey of his downtown-ish artist-friends, most of them trans or gay. And P.P.O.W. has the first New York solo show in 15 years of the Cuban-born painter Manuel Pardo (1952-2012). He was a fixture of the East Village art world of the 1980s, who, with his early nude self-portraits and later images of his imperiously glam mother, deserves a hero's welcome back to town.\n\nSee the April gallery shows here.",

Witnesses reported that a person riding on the back of a motorcycle had hopped off and shot into the passenger side of Mr. Were's car before being whisked away by the motorcycle's driver, the police said.\n\nA motive was not immediately clear. Muchiri Nyaga, a police spokesman, said in a statement on Wednesday that it was too early for the authorities to provide additional details.\n\nPresident William Ruto of Kenya called on the police to \"conduct a thorough investigation\" and expressed his condolences to Mr. Were's family. \"Those responsible must be held to account,\" he said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe police said the driver and another passenger in the car were unharmed in the shooting and quickly drove Mr. Were to Nairobi Hospital, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nMr. Were was re-elected to Parliament in 2022 as a member of the Orange Democratic Movement, the opposition party led by Raila Odinga, Mr. Ruto's main rival in the previous general election.\n\nMr. Odinga, in a statement on Thursday, compared the daytime shooting to \"a gangland-style execution\" that was \"shockingly barbaric.\"\n\nKenya has a reputation as a relatively stable nation in a volatile region. Frustration with the government hit a new high last year during deadly protests against a tax increase. Dozens of people were abducted or arbitrarily detained by security forces, according to activists and human rights groups.\n\nMr. Ruto promoted the tax increase as a necessary measure to curb the country's staggering debt.\n\nA wealthy businessman who grew up poor, Mr. Ruto campaigned on a platform of improving the economy for Kenyans. His critics say that had not happened.\n\nAbdi Latif Dahir contributed reporting.",

            "body": "In an unusual move, the Trump administration pre-emptively sued Hawaii and Michigan to try to stop them from suing oil companies over global warming.\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii said his state intended to sue fossil fuel companies over their role in climate change to make them pay for damage from its effects, like the 2023 wildfires that devastated Maui.\n\n\"I guess this might be breaking news,\" he said during an interview on local television. \"We will be filing suit.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration sued Hawaii first, seeking to block the lawsuit before it could even be filed.\n\nThe Justice Department also filed a nearly identical suit against Michigan, where Attorney General Dana Nessel has retained three private law firms to pursue climate change litigation but has not yet sued. The main thrust of the administration's argument is that the federal government should determine national energy policy, not individual states.\n\nLegal experts said it was highly unusual to sue to block other lawsuits that have yet to be filed.\n\nNine Democratic-led states have already sued fossil fuel companies over climate change, along with dozens of municipalities around the country. The oil industry and its allies have tried to get those cases thrown out by making similar arguments to the ones put forth in the Justice Department filings this week.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIts two lawsuits cite President Trump's April 8 executive order, \"Protecting American Energy From State Overreach,\" which argued that state policies inhibiting the energy industry weaken national security and drive up costs for Americans. It also said that the other lawsuits already filed by states over climate change could result in \"crippling\" damages to oil companies being sued.\n\nMichael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said it was \"at least highly unusual\" to try and preemptively block lawsuits. \"The usual procedure would be to move to intervene in existing lawsuits,\" he said. \"I've never heard of a situation where a lawsuit is filed to seek an injunction against somebody else filing a lawsuit.\"\n\nHe predicted that such a legal strategy would not fare well. \"Procedurally, it's wacky,\" he said.\n\nBoth suits, filed in federal courts in Hawaii and Michigan, named the state, its governor and attorney general. The offices of Mr. Green and the Hawaii attorney general, Anne Lopez, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMs. Nessel called the lawsuit \"at best frivolous and arguably sanctionable.\" She said Mr. Trump had \"made clear he will answer any and every beck and call from his Big Oil campaign donors\" and called the lawsuits \"perhaps the most surprising debasement of both the White House and D.O.J. yet.\"\n\nThe states that have already sued are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont.",

            "body": "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Thousands of people in Serbia on Thursday marked six months since a train station tragedy in the country's north killed 16 people and triggered a wave of anti-corruption protests that have shaken populist President Aleksandar Vucic's tight grip on power.\n\nWorkers' unions joined university students in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, to demand changes in labor and strike laws as part of Labor Day protests. In the northern city of Novi Sad, residents left flowers and lit candles outside the central station where tons of concrete crashed on the people standing or sitting underneath on Nov. 1.\n\nMany in Serbia blamed alleged rampant government corruption fueling negligence and disrespect of safety regulations for the tragedy. The concrete canopy at the outer wall of the building had been renovated twice before the disaster as part of a major infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.\n\nAlmost daily protests since the crash have developed into a nationwide movement demanding changes.\n\nThousands marched in Novi Sad on Thursday after holding a commemorative silence for the victims near the station. University students, a key force behind the anti-graft movement, set up a stone monument with an inscription saying: \"Novi Sad remembers.\"\n\n\"Today, we declared the train station building for a memorial site,\" a student told the crowd. \"It will serve as a reminder what happens when corruption takes over the state.\"\n\nIn Belgrade, union flags mixed with student banners outside the Serbian government building in a downtown area as thousands streamed in from various parts of the city for the gathering.\n\n\"Corruption kills!\" said one student, who did not say his name. \"This is why the fight against corruption must be held not only at (student) blockades but also at work place.\"\n\nPopulist supporters of President Vucic meanwhile enjoyed a May Day barbecue, drinks and folk music in a pro-government camp outside the parliament building and in an adjacent park by the presidential palace. The guarded camp, set up weeks ago, also hosted masked ex-paramilitary fighters apparently as protection for Vucic.\n\nVucic has accused the anti-graft protesters of staging a \"color revolution\" under Western instructions to oust him from power and \"destroy\" Serbia. He has organized parallel rallies to counter almost daily street demonstrations that have drawn tens of thousands of people for some of the biggest ever anti-government rallies in the country.\n\nSerbia's populist leader has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms, including pressure on the protesting students. In the latest incident on Monday in Novi Sad, police used batons and pepper spray while pushing protesters away from a sports faculty building. Several people were injured.\n\nSerbia is formally seeking European Union membership but the accession process recently has been stalled amid Vucic's increasing authoritarianism.",

            "body": "The Trump administration this week slashed $1 billion in so-called \"mental health\" grants for educational institutions, many of which were going to promote leftist ideology and train leftist activists.\n\nThe Education Department confirmed Wednesday that it was making cuts to grants handed out by the Biden administration ostensibly for the purpose of \"mental health\" because of the focus of many of the recipients on racially-focused programs. In a notice to Congress, the administration said it was going to \"re-envision and re-compete\" the funds allocated for mental health at schools in a gun control bill signed by former President Joe Biden.\n\n\"These grants are intended to improve American students' mental health by funding additional mental health professionals in schools and on campuses,\" Deputy Assistant Secretary for Communications Madison Biedermann said. \"Instead, under the deeply flawed priorities of the Biden Administration, grant recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions like recruiting quotas in ways that have nothing to do with mental health and could hurt the very students the grants are supposed to help.\"\n\nThe move was first reported on Tuesday by Christopher Rufo, who wrote on X that there would be \"no more slush fund for activists under the guise of mental health.\"\n\nIn March, the conservative organization Defending Education put out a report finding that the Department of Education had given at least $100,964,880 in grants to 25 universities to increase their social worker training programs ostensibly for the purpose of mental health. Defending Education found that many of these grants were going to programs steeped in leftist ideology.\n\nThis money was allocated through the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program and the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program.\n\nFor example, Portland State University was awarded $1,189,801 by the Department of Education to increase the number of social workers. DEI principles are built into the school's Master of Social Work program, the stated goal of which is to train social workers to dismantle \"systems of oppression; build[] racial equity and social, political, and economic justice.\"\n\n\"The grants were meant to support school counselors and mental health staff. In reality, they became a pipeline for training activist educators steeped in DEI, CRT, and gender ideology. Federal dollars went to universities pushing 'anti-racist social-emotional learning' and racially preferential hiring,\" said Defending Education President Nicki Neily on Thursday. \"Parents want real support for children in crisis, not counselors or social workers trained to divide, shame, and re-educate. Good on the Trump administration for ending this. Now, let's make sure the replacements actually serve students.\"",

However, the department confirmed almost 90 per cent of the koalas were not examined on the ground before they were shot, and authorities could not access carcasses after aerial shootings to check for pouch young.\n\nDEECA says its aerial shooting program, which concluded almost two months after bushfires swept through the park, was conducted as a \"humane action [taken] to prevent further suffering\" of koalas in the national park.\n\nAbout half Budj Bim was burnt in bushfires sparked by a lightning strike on March 1.",

            "body": "President Trump's Justice Department is going on the legal offensive, suing Michigan and Hawaii in two separate lawsuits ahead of the states' planned litigation against fossil fuel companies on climate change.\n\nAfter politicians in both Hawaii and Michigan announced they were planning to sue fossil fuel companies for allegedly contributing to climate change, Mr. Trump's Justice Department beat them to the courthouse.\n\nIn two similar federal lawsuits this week, the federal government argues that the states' plans run afoul of the Clean Air Act, which sets federal standards for pollution across state lines.\n\nThe feds say any state law move to interfere with that is preempted by the federal legislation.\n\nThe lawsuit also says Mr. Trump in an executive order on his first day in office declared that the country is \"facing an energy crisis\" and that energy production is a national security focus.\n\n\"If Michigan is permitted to pursue these sorts of state law claims, other States could pursue similar claims, leading to a chaotic 'patchwork' of regulations that undermine the national interest in readily available and affordable energy and the government's ability to effectively administer coherent national environmental policy and regulation of global pollution,\" the lawsuit filed in the Western District of Michigan read.\n\n\"Such fragmentation would frustrate Congress's intent for a unified federal approach to global air pollution,\" it continued.\n\nLocal outlets reported last year that the state of Michigan had contracted with three major law firms to bring the activist litigation against fossil fuel companies.\n\nThe planned lawsuit, according to the federal government, would interfere with foreign commerce, interstate gas emissions and national energy policy.\n\n\"The financial burdens of Michigan's anticipated lawsuit on fossil fuel businesses increase the United States' costs for purchasing fuels and threaten revenue from federal leasing,\" the complaint read. \"The United States seeks to protect citizens nationwide from higher energy costs and economic disruption caused by Michigan's anticipated overreach.\"\n\nThe Justice Department asked the courts to enjoin both states from filing such a lawsuit as unconstitutional.\n\nSimilarly, the feds filed a lawsuit against Hawaii in the District of Hawaii just two days after its governor announced they would be filing a case against big oil companies to get them to pay for damages he says were caused by climate change due to the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\"We will be filing suit, I believe, on Thursday against the fossil fuel companies. They have to pay their share because climate change and the climate impact is definitely connected to generations of extra fossil fuel that's been burned,\" Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said, according to local Fox affiliate KHON.\n\nHis office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Trump administration's lawsuit. A spokesperson from the Michigan attorney general's office also did not respond to a query from The Washington Times.\n\nThe city of Honolulu, along with California and other cities across the country, have launched climate change related claims against major fuel producers like Exxon and Chevron.\n\nWhile some of the efforts have been dismissed by judges, others are still working their way through the court system.\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuits say that over restrictive policies have caused a decrease in American energy development, creating a crisis. That led to the president signing the Protecting American Energy From State Overreach executive order on his first day in office and declaring a national energy crisis.\n\n\"As a result of state restrictions and burdens on energy production, the American people are paying more for energy, and the United States is less able to defend itself from hostile foreign actors,\" the federal government said in its litigation.",

            "body": "Wisconsin Supreme Court removed the argument that she was some kind of hero\n\nJudge Hannah Dugan is screwed. Even the liberal Wisconsin Supreme Court issued an order suspending her from performing her judicial duties. The Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge is charged with two federal criminal offenses: one felony and one misdemeanor. The Supreme Court took away the argument that she was some kind of hero unfairly targeted by the Trump administration. Instead, she is a suspended judge facing serious federal charges.\n\nFBI agents arrested Judge Dugan last Friday. She was charged with two federal crimes: concealing a person from discovery and arrest and obstruction of federal government proceedings. Each charge stems from her alleged misdirection of federal agents from detaining Eduardo Flores-Ruiz.\n\nAccording to court documents, Mr. Flores-Ruiz was set to appear in court on April 18 for a pretrial conference for a case in which he was charged with several counts of battery and domestic abuse. FBI Director Kash Patel said on social media that authorities \"believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, allowing the subject -- an illegal alien -- to evade arrest. Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public.\"\n\nLiberals went wild but ignored the facts. Law enforcement officers often make arrests in courthouses for two obvious reasons: They can track when the suspect is in court, and most locations have security scanning so officers can take someone into custody without fear of the suspect hiding firearms. It just makes sense.\n\nLiberals also falsely suggest that the Trump administration is \"weaponizing law enforcement\" for its benefit. Besides the breathtaking list of ridiculous charges against President Trump, the more important point is that they do not dispute the facts laid out in the charges.\n\nJudge Hannah Dugan was not arrested for failing to cooperate with federal agents or going along with their actions. The charges against her are specifically for actions that led to obstruction of justice.\n\nIt is important to remember that a sworn magistrate in the federal courts reviewed the information and found probable cause before they brought charges against Judge Dugan. They had to make their case before they made an arrest.\n\nEduardo Flores-Ruiz was charged with counts of battery, domestic abuse, and infliction of physical pain or injury. A criminal complaint states he intentionally elbowed a woman, which caused her pain and bruising. He was also accused of punching his roommate 30 times with a closed fist. The girlfriend of the roommate tried to stop it, and Mr. Flores-Ruiz struck her with a closed fist and shoved her, according to the criminal complaint. He is also accused of grabbing his roommate by the neck -- a real role model.\n\nFederal agents were there to arrest him because Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified him as an illegal immigrant from Mexico, someone U.S. Border Patrol agents removed on Jan. 13, 2013, under the Obama administration. This is key because once someone has received an expedited removal order, the federal government can deport them without a court hearing.\n\nOn April 18, federal agents agreed to arrest Mr. Flores-Ruiz in the hallway outside the courtroom after the hearing. According to the FBI, the defense attorney told Judge Dugan that ICE was there to arrest Mr. Flores-Ruiz. The judge ordered him to sit in the jury box and stay there. Then, she went into the hallway to confront the ICE agents and demand that they leave the courthouse. After they presented her with an arrest warrant, she demanded that they see the chief judge.\n\nWhile the federal officers were waiting to see the chief judge, Judge Dugan returned to her courtroom and adjourned the hearing without talking to the prosecutor or the victims. Then, she took Mr. Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through the jury door, and they left through a private hallway.\n\nFortunately for those of us who believe in the rule of law, a federal agent saw Mr. Flores-Ruiz trying to leave the courthouse and followed him. The agent called for backup. After a foot chase, the officers caught him. This put the agents and the general public at risk instead of the orderly process originally planned for taking him into custody outside the courtroom after the hearing.\n\nThese are the facts. I have yet to see any liberal apologist for suspended Judge Hannah Dugan dispute them. Instead, they try to use this as a platform to protest the policies of the Trump administration.\n\nSuspended Judge Dugan is a liberal activist. She ran against a well-qualified and respected incumbent because I appointed him. In a very liberal county, she won. Yet even in that county, the law applies to everyone -- even a judge.\n\nAccording to the charges, her actions obstructed justice. They prevented the arrest of a fugitive. She helped him leave the building in a way that would avoid arrest by federal agents. She put those officers and even the general public at risk by forcing them to make the arrest outside after a chase. She dismissed the interests of the victims in her courtroom. These are the facts she must now face in a federal courtroom.\n\nThe actions by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, ruled by a liberal majority, to suspend her authority to serve as a judge are just the beginning of her legal troubles. Others should take notice. No one is above the law.",

            "body": "The Spanish government boasted last month that it had become a global leader in fueling its economy with windmills and solar panels. Among leftists, there is no higher virtue to signal than replacing nuclear, gas and coal plants with these in-vogue alternatives.\n\nShortly after achieving this green energy miracle, Spain and Portugal's 60 million citizens were plunged into darkness not experienced since medieval times, when, not coincidentally, windmills were widely used as a power source. NASA satellite imagery captured the blackout stretching across the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nModern Europeans brag about the superiority of their electric train network, but some Spanish passengers may have entertained second thoughts when powerless locomotives left them stranded for hours. Even gasoline-fueled cars slowed without traffic lights to guide the chaos on the streets of Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon.\n\nThose stuck in dark, high-rise elevators had no way to summon help when cellphone towers stopped transmitting. The public resorted to cash or barter to pay for what food or drink remained in markets swiftly emptied by panic buying.\n\nThe responsible authorities in Spain haven't been forthcoming about what caused the disruption. Ordinarily, \"renewable\" systems reliant on sun and wind power run out of juice on cloudy and windless days, but the situation here appears more complex. Portugal imports power from Spain, and its electric company, REN, said it had to disconnect when the Spanish network experienced a \"significant oscillation.\"\n\nUnder that theory, a glut of sunlight produced a surplus of solar electricity over a short period, introducing a dangerous imbalance into Spain's grid. Automated circuit breakers shut down everything to prevent a destructive surge from coursing through the entire system.\n\nCommon sense suggests that such things happen when one relies on volatile power sources dependent upon Mother Nature's whims. Many on the left would rather blame the catastrophe on climate change.\n\nThey're right to do so. Madrid's socialist government is obsessed with achieving \"net zero\" carbon dioxide emissions. That's why, in 2023, Spain ordered the decommissioning of all nuclear plants, with the final demolition scheduled in 2035.\n\n\"The renewable transformation in our country is now a reality,\" Spain's electricity provider recently bragged, adding it had \"successfully integrated over 98% of renewable generation at the peninsular level, a figure significantly higher than those recorded by neighbouring European countries.\"\n\nSpain didn't bother accounting for the downside of this strategy. \"When you hitch your wagon to the weather, it's just a risky endeavor,\" U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright observed on CNBC. \"Even in standard operating conditions, it's just driven up the price of energy so much in Europe.\"\n\nDespite the volatility and expense, Democrats on this side of the Atlantic want Uncle Sam to continue paying companies to set up wind turbines everywhere. These projects are somehow an act of \"environmental justice\" even though their merciless blades slice through thousands of eagles, hawks and condors every year.\n\nInvestors also saturate once-pristine landscapes with massive solar arrays, hoping to turn those environmental subsidies into big profits. Thanks to November's election results, however, this madness is ending. President Trump has canceled permits for offshore windmill installations.\n\nThe Interior Department has ordered Empire Offshore Wind to halt construction on a massive project for the New York Power Authority and Consolidated Edison. Manhattan liberals, like Spain, were gung-ho about doing whatever it took to increase their renewable bragging rights.",

            "body": "When the Catholic cardinals enter the conclave to elect the next pope, MAGA faithful will be hoping a conservative tribune emerges victorious.\n\nThe \"fight for the soul of the Catholic Church\" is happening, and it's between those leaders who saw promise in the modernising changes Pope Francis made and those \"who hated him for it\", according to religious scholars.\n\nWhen Jorge Mario Bergoglio was introduced to the world as the next pope in 2013, he took the name Francis -- a name no pope had ever taken.\n\nSaint Francis of Assisi represented the poor, the humble and was the patron saint of ecology.\n\nPope Francis would come to make his papacy in that image.\n\nHe was not a perfect progressive ally and, for many, his promises of change remain just that, but for an institution that measures time in centuries, Pope Francis represented a new, much more open era.\n\nFor many Catholics, it was extraordinary to hear a pontiff talk about his own sins and to hear him say: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\n\nPope Francis offered the 1.4 billion followers of the Catholic faith across the world a voice of modern morality -- he sought to care for them, and was concerned more with how the church could improve their lives than theological doctrine.\n\nBut for his critics, Pope Francis veered too far from the religion's rules, and threatened to change them.\n\nIn particular, as he made statements about climate change, immigration and same-sex marriage, Pope Francis clashed with an ideological force taking over the Republican Party in the United States.\n\nNow, data shows American Catholics are split unlike any other major religion.\n\nBecause for decades, the architects of the so-called religious right in the United States have been building a coalition of church-going voters.\n\nThese Americans can be relied upon to show up on election day and to vote for the candidate who promises to uphold the idea of traditional Christian family values.\n\nTheir politics and their faith are fused.\n\nThere have been some obvious galvanising causes -- the movement is against access to abortion, it is for the homeschooling of children. It holds very traditional views for the role of women and it does not want the United States to be multicultural.\n\nMormons as well as Southern Baptists and followers of a list of other Protestant evangelical faiths are now the most likely to vote Republican and, according to religious scholars, hold the most socially conservative views.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, there was a risk the Catholic Church led by Pope Francis could be seen as a more liberal faith in the United States.\n\nJoe Biden, after all, is a proud Catholic.\n\nBut then so is Steve Bannon, and like other MAGA players, he wants Catholicism to be reclaimed for conservatives.\n\nA US cardinal has never been pope, reportedly because the Vatican has viewed the nation has having too much influence over the church.\n\nThere are reports conservative American Catholics are in Rome right now, lobbying for an outcome in their favour.\n\nSo the stage is set. MAGA followers want the next pope to bring Catholicism back to its roots, but part of the legacy of Francis is that he had long been preparing to stop them.\n\nPope Francis vs MAGA\n\nOnce upon a time, JD Vance called himself an atheist and a \"never Trumper\". Now, he's Donald Trump's vice president and the poster boy for a new era of American Catholicism.\n\nVance's path to personal and political redemption led him to sit opposite Pope Francis just hours before the pontiff died.\n\nIt was a moment religious scholars have reflected on as one of great symbolism because it was a meeting of two very different movements -- Pope Francis as the church's truth itself, and Vance, someone who represents the outlier US traditionalism has become.\n\nThe issue that helps explain the diverging of Pope Francis and MAGA most clearly perhaps is immigration and the treatment of migrants.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a hardline approach on immigration and is planning the mass deportation of migrants, while it forcibly detains and deports some who are in the country legally.\n\nFrancis called Trump's immigration plans a \"disgrace\" and criticised his cuts to foreign aid and domestic welfare programs.\n\nIn 2016, Pope Francis went so far as to say Trump was \"not Christian\" -- again over his approach to immigration and the building of his border wall.\n\nPope Francis was a man who washed the feet of prisoners -- who believed the people of the world were equalised by their very humanity.\n\nHe was the son of Italian immigrants himself and placed the plight of migrants and refugees at the heart of his moral agenda during his 12-year papacy.\n\nA few months ago, JD Vance attempted to use a theological concept to justify the Trump administration's mass deportation plan and Pope Francis promptly corrected him.\n\nOn Fox News, Vance spoke about the order of love.\n\n\"There's this old school -- and I think it's a very Christian -- concept by the way, that you love your family, and then you love your neighbour, and then you love your community, then you love your fellow citizens in your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritise the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nLess than a fortnight later, Pope Francis penned a rare open letter to all US Catholic bishops, once again slamming Trump's immigration policy and directly refuting Vance's interpretation of the concept of ordo amoris, or order of love.\n\n\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan' ... by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"\n\nProfessor of religion at Dartmouth College Randall Balmer told the ABC Pope Francis took issue with Vance's suggestion love could be prioritised.\n\n\"Vance was trying to use that as a justification for Trump's immigration policies and turning people away from US borders and Francis was having none of it,\" he said.\n\n\"Vance has been trying to cloak his policies, and by extension, cloak Trump's policies in Catholic doctrine and Catholic social teaching, but Francis was pretty quick to disavow that connection.\"\n\nConservatives were unhappy with Pope Francis from the start because of his informal style, his aversion to pomp and his decision to allow women and people of the Muslim faith to take part in a Holy Thursday ritual that previously had been restricted to Catholic men.\n\nThey baulked at his approval of conditional blessings for same-sex couples and Pope Francis's repeated clampdowns on the use of Latin Mass.\n\nMAGA firebrand, self-styled media mogul, and former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon has been a vocal critic of Pope Francis, and after the pontiff's death, has been all over YouTube talking about his work to drag the church backwards.\n\nHe believes that is what a rising tide of American Catholics want.\n\n\"This is another massive institution that means so much about turning our world around. The Catholic Church has been taken over by these globalists and it's not good, really not good,\" he said on his War Room program.\n\nHe told Piers Morgan: \"I think a lot of people, particularly the rising part of the church in America would at least like to see a pope that is accessible to traditional teachings and gets the Catholic Church back on an orthodox pattern.\"\n\n\"I have been very open. I've worked for years with more of the conservative, traditionalist cardinals and people at the Vatican ... it's been a very tough and vicious fight and this will continue on.\"\n\nTaking a look at the data, there are some clear trends that help explain just how divided the Catholic Church is in the United States and how Donald Trump arrived at just the right time.\n\nReligious support for Trump\n\nPope Francis was just a few years into his papacy when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president of the United States in 2015.\n\nAmericans of faith had been trending Republican, and were then presented with a candidate who very loudly promised to answer their call.\n\n\"There's some sort of visceral way that people in the religious right, white evangelicals and I would add, traditionalist Catholics, see themselves as being victims in this multicultural society,\" Dr Balmer said.\n\n\"They see themselves somehow as being kicked to the sidelines. And [think] 'we need to fight back', 'we need to resist that in some way', and Trump speaks that language, I think, very, very fluently'.\"\n\nHe tells his base \"we have to somehow vanquish our enemies or deport them ... in order to reassert that hegemonic hold on society\", Dr Balmer said.\n\nHe would eventually build some of the wall he promised.\n\nAnd deliver the US Supreme Court and its overturning of Roe v Wade -- the case that served as a lightning rod for religious conservatives.\n\nDonald Trump has long been able to rely on his loyal evangelical base and in his 2024 general election win, Trump did as well among that group as he did in his 2020 loss.\n\nBut Trump is winning more of the Catholic vote, while Democrats are losing their grip on it, according to AP Vote Cast.\n\nAnd according to the latest survey by Pew Research Centre, 53 per cent of American Catholics now identify or lean Republican. In 2014, that number was 37 per cent.\n\nThere are other trends too.\n\nAmerican Catholics are also split on racial lines and, in recent years, on their opinion of Pope Francis.\n\nSenior associate director at Pew Research Gregory Smith said in the early years of his papacy, Pope Francis was viewed favourably by American Catholics across the political spectrum.\n\n\"But the share of Catholic Republicans who had a favourable view of Francis began to trend downward, and so you saw this gap open up between Catholic Democrats and Republicans,\" he said.\n\nAt the far-right end of that spectrum is a group of American Catholics who want more than their man at the head of the church, but for the United States itself to become more religious.\n\n'A fight for the soul of the Catholic Church'\n\nThe conservative swing inside the Catholic Church in America echoes the rise of the right across the world, according to professor of religious studies at the University of Florida and scholar of the religious right Julie Ingersol.\n\n\"The rise of this very conservative form of Catholicism is, in some ways, a reaction to the kinds of things that Pope Francis did and supported,\" she said.\n\n\"He stepped away from focus on the culture war divisions, and tried to focus more just on people, recognising that people had all kinds of differences.\"\n\nDr Ingersol studies Christian nationalism and said the Catholic thread in American conservatism ultimately wants to see \"more of a union of the church and the state\".\n\n\"There's always been a thread in American Catholicism that is deeply conservative, and it parallels some of the developments in Protestantism that are working for a theocracy,\" she said.\n\nIn JD Vance they see \"one of their own\" and \"their version of Catholicism near the top of American power\", Dr Ingersol said.\n\nJust as traditionalist Catholics have ascended to those heights in the United States, there is an opening at the top of the Vatican and a chance to own the church's next era too.\n\nPope Francis knew he faced fierce opposition inside the Vatican and while he largely ignored it while he was alive, he prepared for the fight that would happen after his death.\n\nLate Australian cardinal George Pell once penned a memo declaring his papacy \"a catastrophe\".\n\nUS cardinal and dominant figure among traditionalist American Catholics Raymond Burke once said the church under Francis was \"a ship without a rudder\".\n\nPope Francis would later strip Burke of some of his Vatican privileges. He also stood down a deeply conservative, social media-loving, Trump-supporting bishop in Texas who took issue with his statements on the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nOf the cardinals who will vote to elect his successor, Pope Francis stacked the house and appointed 80 per cent of them, so the maths isn't in his critics' favour.\n\nBut as in politics, the vote can always swing.\n\nNo matter who is elected the next pope, they will have to contend with a US arm of the Catholic Church that is split.\n\nBeyond the culture wars that Donald Trump so easily stokes, Dr Balmer believes \"the real battleground\" could become the issue of Latin Mass.\n\n\"They may want to agitate to continue their use of the Latin Mass and maybe expand it beyond what he wanted. At certain certain point, you have to ask: ... is this a church going in two different directions?\" he said.\n\n\"If there's a division over that, then in some sense, you're not talking about a single church any longer.\"",

            "body": "From the middle of July, nations will gather in Jamaica to resume International Seabed Authority meetings to discuss developments on deep-sea mining and a moratorium.\n\nLying at the bottom of the ocean, thousands of metres below the surface, are reserves of what are considered to be the world's most critical minerals.\n\nIn the Pacific Ocean between North America and Hawaii lies a large area known as the Clarion-Clipperton zone -- a particularly abundant area filled with copper, cobalt and nickel.\n\nNow, the race is on to start mining these minerals.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to open both US and international waters to deep-sea mining, ignoring a global treaty that controls the high seas.\n\nThe order was signed last week with the aim of boosting US production of critical minerals by mining mineral-rich \"nodules\" that take millions of years to form on the seabed.\n\nThe race to the seabed\n\nThe order states its purpose is to \"establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration\".\n\nThe race to the seabed has also sparked fear among environmentalists that it could permanently damage marine life.\n\nThe United Nations, environmental groups and a number of countries -- including China -- have accused Donald Trump of violating international law in ordering the fast-tracking of approval processes for deep-sea mining in US waters and international waters.\n\nThe order sidesteps the UN's International Seabed Authority, which has prevented such mining in international waters while it works on governance frameworks.\n\nScientists and climate activists also warn that changes to biodiversity could be irreversible if commercial mining of the seabed goes ahead.\n\nThirty-two countries are calling for a moratorium or precautionary ban until more is understood about the deep sea.\n\n\"There's a lot of species that depend directly or indirectly on the nodules to live because they live on top, underneath or around the nodules,\" deep-sea ecologist Dr Patricia Esquete said.\n\nCountries including France have applied international pressure on the Australian government to ratify a high seas treaty protecting deep-sea biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions.\n\nWhile it appears that will happen by June, calls from the UK and some Pacific Island nations for Australia to join a moratorium on deep-sea mining have not been answered.\n\nWhat is deep-sea mining? And who wants to do it?\n\nDeep-sea mining is the extraction of minerals -- mainly polymetallic nodules rich in cobalt, nickel, and manganese -- that lie on the seabed at about 4,000 metres below sea-level.\n\nCountries have the right to regulate mining activities within their exclusive economic zones.\n\nThe International Seabed Authority (ISA), established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, regulates mining in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\n\nA Canadian mining company has sought a permit from the Trump administration to begin commercial deep-sea mining in the Clarion-Clipperton zone, which some experts have described as a breach of international law.\n\nThe Metals Company (TMC) last month announced on its website it was seeking a permit to begin mining in international waters.\n\nThis week, it has submitted a commercial recovery permit under the US Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act.\n\nTMC has been one of many companies and countries undertaking exploratory work in the deep sea, spending hundreds of millions of dollars examining various minerals.\n\nHowever, given how little is known about the deep sea, rules and regulations for commercial mining, created by the ISA, will not be ready for several more years.\n\n\"[TMC] realised that they're not going to get a mining permit through the ISA anytime soon,\" said Phil McCabe from the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.\n\n\"A few weeks ago, they told the world that actually we're going to bypass the ISA and we're going to go for the USA ...\n\n\"We need more information, more scientific information and that takes time,\" Mr McCabe said.\n\nTMC chief executive Gerard Barron told ABC News the company first collected nodules at a commercial scale in 2022 and that \"the missing piece has really been the regulatory certainty\".\n\nThe ISA has condemned the announcement from TMC, stating the company \"continues to disregard all scientific and economic warnings about the industry's risks\".\n\nRick Valenta, director of the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland, said the zone covers an area \"just under 80 per cent of the size of Australia\" and granted license area is \"about the size of Tasmania\".\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told ABC News that Australia doesn't condone deep-sea mining beyond national jurisdiction without the regulatory framework currently being negotiated by the ISA.\n\nHowever, DFAT said TMC's announcement of a proposed application is a matter for TMC and the US government.\n\nInformation void as research in its infancy\n\nDeep-sea ecologist Dr Esquete said because the deep sea has been so difficult to access, research in these parts of the world is only in its \"infancy\".\n\n\"It's been overlooked for many years, so we're just starting to understand and starting to reach ecosystems that had not been reached for decades,\" she told ABC News.\n\nA recent study in the journal Nature analysed the impacts on a 46-year-old test mining site in the Clarion-Clipperton zone.\n\n\"We found persistent impacts, lasting for nearly half a century, to the seabed environment and particularly the larger animals living in the area,\" UK National Oceanography Centre biogeosciences head Daniel Jones said.\n\n\"We also found the first early signs of a recovery process starting to take place, with some mobile animals returning to the tracks and shelled-amoeba-like xenophyophores recolonising.\n\n\"This early snapshot of ecological succession, where the species change over time, is what happens in most ecosystems after disturbance.\n\nThe study looked at a 400-square-metre impact site but the ISA has granted 17 exploration contracts to would-be miners covering a total area of 1.28 million square kilometres.\n\nMr Barron said TMC has spent \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" over the past 14 years on environmental research to understand the impact of commercial deep-sea mining.\n\n\"Comparing those impacts to land-based alternatives, studying the recovery rates, and what the conclusions all point to is that the impacts are a fraction compared to land-based alternatives,\" he said.\n\nBut Dr Esquete believes the environmental impacts will be \"way higher\" than what TMC tries to portray.\n\n\"They are very special because they are completely different from any other environment on earth.\n\n\"They have very special adaptations from which we can learn from and learn about the origin of life.\"\n\nWhat this means for international law\n\nInternational environmental lawyer Duncan Currie said even though the US hasn't ratified the ISA, it has signed a more recent 1994 agreement, meaning the US is \"bound by the law of the sea conventions\".\n\n\"It's essentially the crucial provision about the deep sea being of common heritage of humankind ... at the very least, what's called customary international law, which means binding on everybody,\" he said.\n\nMr Currie said one of his biggest concerns of this possible permit is what it means for international law.\n\n\"The Sea Convention also controls things like freedom of navigation, maritime boundaries, fishing rights [and] the Marine scientific research,\" he said.\n\n\"...the whole host of really important matters, which are absolutely crucial to many, many countries come under the governance of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea.\n\n\"So if one country is driving a coach and horses through the law of the sea convention ... then I think many countries are going to be deeply concerned about that.\"\n\nSea law expert Karen Scott has another view -- that because the US was not a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), in principle there was nothing to prevent it from developing its own regime.\n\nBut Professor Scott, from New Zealand's University of Canterbury, said one section of UNCLOS, part XI, could still be binding as customary international law.\n\nIndigenous community concerned about impact\n\nAmong those worried about the effects of deep-sea mining are Indigenous people from the New Ireland Province in Papua New Guinea.\n\nJonathan Mesulam is the founder and coordinator of West Coast Development Foundation, a PNG-based non-governmental organisation.\n\nHe is working to promote conservation and warned the effects of deep-sea mining won't just affect the ocean.\n\n\"In New Ireland we have this culture where people go out, go out and catch the fish ... what will we tell our kids, the future generation, that we want to have this kind of culture.\n\n\"If we destroy our culture, then we will destroy our identity.\"\n\nIn the Cook Islands, Prime Minister Mark Brown is supportive of deep-sea mining, telling ABC News' The Pacific program that it could unlock access to financing which would build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\n\nBut ocean conservation advocate Lousia Castledine, who lives in the South Pacific's largest island, Rarotonga, said she is concerned about the environmental, cultural, social, and spiritual impacts of the industry.\n\n\"What we see here is a shift from protecting our environment that has long sustained us as a people to exploiting it in a way that is irreversible,\" the spokesperson for Ocean Ancestors said.\n\nCalls for a moratorium\n\nPhil McCabe has been one of the key figures pushing for a moratorium over the last five years under the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.\n\n\"Anything that puts peace and security at risk just needs to be looked at really carefully,\" he said.\n\n\"We are much better off to take some time and gather the scientific knowledge and understanding that enables proper evidence based decisions around it.\"\n\nBut he said he is \"completely bewildered\" as to why Australia hasn't shown its support.\n\n\"There's no benefit to Australia from deep-sea mining going ahead in international waters, there's no commercial interest from Australian entities. If anything, opening up the deep sea and minerals that exist there could negatively impact Australia's economy,\" he said.\n\nDFAT told ABC News that Australia participates in the negotiations surrounding a framework that will govern deep-sea mining and recognises there are a range of views around the mining.\n\nIt added that Australia supports Pacific Island countries to manage their own ocean resources.\n\nSamantha Climie has been making representations to the federal government on behalf of Look Down Action -- a youth organisation rallying to stop deep-sea mining -- and said Australia has an \"important role to play\".\n\n\"Australia very much positions itself as a leader in the Pacific and wants to support a lot of Pacific Island nations,\" she said.\n\nMs Climie said she has reached out to the government but hasn't received a response to date.\n\n\"I think it's really important and urgent that Australia does [join the call for a moratorium] in the lead up to the ISA's meeting in July.\"\n\nFrom the middle of July, nations will gather in Jamaica to resume the ISA Council and Assembly Meetings to discuss developments on deep-sea mining and the moratorium.\n\nAs scientists and conservationists warn just how much is at stake, the US executive order means the race towards commercial mining has already started.",

It will also be biodegradable and \"innovative and ethically sound.\"\n\nUnlike naysayers, Connon said it will soon become a reality.\n\n\"The hard bit is making leather from cells, and we've done that,\" Connon told The Post. \"The upstream bit is using existing technologies, which is why we're confident we can do this so quickly.\"\n\nThe initial implementation of T. rex leather will focus on accessories with a goal to produce a flagship commercial luxury fashion item by the end of the year.\n\nEventually, once production gets larger, this could open the door to possibilities beyond the fashion industry, such as the automotive sector.\n\n\"With T-Rex leather we're harnessing the biology of the past to create the luxury materials of the future,\" Bas Korsten, Global Chief Creative Officer, Innovation & CCO EMEA at VML, said in a statement.\n\n\"Part of it is the fact that it's demonstrating that you can start to create new materials that have never been formed before,\" Connon said. \"So the same process could be used to create much stronger, for example, or change color or a whole host of things that are feasible but have never been seen before.\"\n\nIn order to create it, synthetic DNA will be used to engineer cells that will then be integrated into an Elemental-X product stream, utilizing a scaffold-free approach that allows the cells to merge in their own natural structure.\n\nConnon explained that he and his team spent 15 years in university doing tissue engineering, then three to four years at the company to get to the point of making the skin and the leather.\n\n\"This project is a remarkable example of how we can harness cutting-edge genome and protein engineering to create entirely new materials,\" Thomas Mitchell, CEO of The Organoid Company, commented.\n\n\"By reconstructing and optimizing ancient protein sequences, we can design T. Rex leather, a biomaterial inspired by prehistoric biology, and clone it into a custom-engineered cell line.\"\n\nAccording to VML, the T. rex leather is a cell-grown performance material that is more than just imitation and provides the natural durability, repairability and tactility that's already expected in high-end luxury leather goods.\n\nHowever, not all scientists are digging the revelations. One dinosaur expert told Live Science he thinks the claim of making T. rex leather is \"misleading\" and \"what this company is doing seems to be fantasy.\"\n\n\"We have NO preserved tyrannosaurid DNA (indeed, not Mesozoic dinosaur DNA sequences), so there are no T. rex genes,\" Thomas Holtz, Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland, told the outlet.\n\nDNA starts to decay as soon as an animal dies, though some fragments might remain in the environment for a few million years. The oldest preserved DNA on record is about 2 million years old, and the T. rex went extinct 66 million years ago.\n\nHoltz added that paleontologists have only found T. rex collagen in bone, not skin, which is the basis for leather, and that researchers don't have access to good tyrannosaurid skin samples since it's rarely preserved in fossils.\n\nSome experts are less skeptical, noting that while it may be possible, any chance of getting results soon isn't likely, and when they do, it'll be expensive.\n\nThe \"gimmick\" is at a \"very early stage,\" Tom Ellis, professor of synthetic genome engineering at Imperial College London, told NBC. \"I doubt that our knowledge of dinosaur evolution is good enough to be able to design a collagen gene specifically from T. rex.\"\n\nEllis added that producing real T. rex leather is \"very far-fetched,\" and the properties of any collagen results are likely to be similar to those of a cow or chicken, which means that it would look and feel the same as any other alternative leather.\n\nThough the T. rex collagen \"gives them something that is at least unique and can justify a much higher price,\" he said.\n\nBut Connon rebuked the notion that it's not possible, telling The Post that \"some people have got the wrong end of the stick saying, well, you can't do it. That's not true.\"\n\n\"Some of that seems to be around, there is no T-Rex skin, but leather isn't skin. It's a component of skin,\" he explained. \"So that's a bit of confusion there. The technologies there are incredible, but they are very much there. And I think the challenge is, there's a lot to bring people up to speed with.\"\n\nAs he explained, the collagen fragments extracted are available from blood vessels or micro-vessels in bone, and the blood vessels have the same biological makeup as skin. \"It's the structural part of the skin, which forms leather.\"\n\n\"People aren't aware of all the different technologies or aware that they exist, so putting them together is quite a bit of a mental leap for people,\" Connon said. \"But rest assured, these are all things that have been proven.\"\n\nThe researchers also stressed the environmental and ethical consequences of the lab-grown leather as well. Since traditional leather production is a component of extensive deforestation and the tanning process often uses harmful chemicals, this new approach can not only reduce negative environmental impacts but also put an end to animal cruelty concerns.\n\n\"Dinosaurs evolved to survive in extreme environments -- conditions our planet is once again beginning to face due to accelerated climate change,\" the news release also explained.",

            "body": "The agents took a knee - a gesture to express dissent against perceived racial injustices - during Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, DC, in June of 2020.\n\nAt least four of the kneelers were reassigned to positions widely viewed as demotions, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe transferred agents previously held senior roles in counterintelligence, counterterrorism and cybercrimes, the outlet reported.\n\nThey were not given a reason for their transfers, according to the publication.\n\nThe decision by the agents to take a knee was viewed by some as necessary to de-escalate the demonstration - as several Floyd-related protests turned violent that summer - and by others as a political statement.\n\n\"Those agents were not ever trained to be in that situation,\" a former agent familiar with the matter told the Washington Post. \"Riot control is not our mission. We are trained to de-escalate.''\n\nThe FBI Agents Association reportedly rewarded the kneelers with $100 gift cards for their actions during the protest.\n\nFormer Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) claimed in 2023 that he had learned some of the kneeling agents received \"plum personnel opportunities and promotions and advancements\" from the bureau.\n\n\"Many FBI personnel we were trusting to be on the front lines were photographed kneeling in surrender to people who at times were violent,\" Gaetz told Fox News at the time.\n\n\"To climb the ladder in federal employment, you shouldn't have to shimmy up the woke totem pole,\" he added, describing the behavior of the agents as \"demoralizing.\"\n\n\"The purpose of law enforcement is to keep people safe, not to engage in politics,\" Gaetz argued.\n\n\"And for the last several years, we've seen the FBI more interested in virtue signaling and political activity than in just the nuts and bolts in evaluating the facts and the law.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has reportedly moved to investigate, reassign and oust several senior FBI officials, including those involved in the raid of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence and the investigation of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot participants.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on personnel matters.\n\nOriginally published as FBI demotes agents who took a knee during Washington DC Black Lives Matter protests in 2020: report",

            "body": "Election day is nearly upon us and the polls seem pretty well set - after a surge in support Labor is leading the Coalition on the national vote 52-48 on average across major polls.\n\nBut privately both major parties think this contest will still be tight.\n\nSo where should you be looking on election night to know which way the contest is going?\n\nAs votes come in, keep an eye on what is happening to the primary vote of the two major parties.\n\nThe Coalition need an improvement from last election when 35.7 per cent of the national vote delivered them only 58 seats.\n\nFor Labor they barely managed majority government with 32.6 per cent of the vote - a likely change in preference flow this time around means they will need a higher vote if they are to avoid losing seats.\n\nDeep into this campaign, it's emerging that the further you go out in metropolitan areas, the bigger the swing will be.\n\nBut the problem for the Liberal Party is some of those outer urban areas also have bigger margins, with Melbourne a good example.\n\nWe will almost certainly see swings in McEwen (margin 3.8 per cent), Bruce (5.3 per cent), Dunkley (6.8 per cent), Hawke (7.6 per cent) and Gorton (10 per cent).\n\nIf they all fall it will be game on, but for every seat in which you see a decent swing to the Opposition (three per cent plus) without it changing hands, it's effectively wasted swing for the Coalition.\n\nThe Coalition's swing in several key seats could be enhanced by One Nation.\n\nThe party managed only five per cent at the last election, but current opinion polling has them getting up to 10 per cent.\n\nIt won't be enough to win any lower house seats, but the party does best in the outer suburbs meaning their vote there could be more like 15 per cent.\n\nIt could be enough perhaps to help tip several seats from Labor to Liberal.\n\nAnd in the senate, it could be enough to get One Nation an extra 3 senate positions, which would really shake-up the upper house.\n\nThe size of the crossbench will be crucial at this election, in particular for the Coalition.\n\nIt lost a staggering nine seats to Teals and Greens last time, and if can't claw any of them back, it makes it a very hard path back to government, because only a few of the MPs who ousted Liberals last time would give supply and confidence to Peter Dutton in a minority scenario.\n\nThere is the prospect of going backwards - with Climate 200 backing repeat candidates on close margins in Bradfield, Cowper, and Wannon.\n\nThat would be a hammer blow to the Opposition's overall chances.\n\nThe Coalition start this election 22 seats behind Labor, so like the Brisbane Lions' semi-final comeback from 44 points down, its job will be much easier if it doesn't let the Opposition have any wins.\n\nAny seats that go from blue to red will have extra significance on Saturday night.\n\nLabor is eyeing off seats in every state except WA (where it already has a stranglehold) so there is not one area to look for here, but it has half a dozen or so seats it feels it can genuinely win from the Liberal party.\n\nEven if only two to three of those actually fall, it will make the mountain too high to climb for the Opposition.\n\nBeware the early vote - the first votes that will come in on Saturday night will be small regional booths in Tasmania.\n\nIn 2022 some Labor insiders panicked when these booths showed no real swing - but of course it turned out the booths - and indeed Tasmania as a state - bucked the national trend.\n\nAnd equally beware the late vote - prepoll turnout is set to reach a new high, and these bigger booths take longer to count.\n\nThis means seats can fluctuate dramatically even late in to the night as big booths take longer to count, all adding to the drama as Australians wait to see who will form the next government after May 3.",

            "body": "\"Fabric is not made on demand. There are minimum order quantities, and there are typically huge amounts of excess fabrics left over from production because of this, and this is pervasive across the industry,\" said Holm.\n\nSince its inception in 2008, the Chinese-founded company has faced allegations regarding its ethical and environmental practices, such as greenwashing, overproduction, poor work conditions, and the use of slave and child labour.\n\nShein's own sustainability report revealed the company's carbon emissions had almost tripled in three years, making it the biggest polluter in the fashion industry.\n\nIt has sought to shake off criticisms by billing itself as environmentally minded and has outlined efforts to implement sustainable practices in its business model, primarily through an initiative called EvoluShein by Design. Shein has committed millions to initiatives tackling environmental waste, has pledged to use 31 per cent recycled polyester by 2030, and uses deadstock fabric in a small percentage of its clothing.\n\n\"Sustainability is a journey, it's not a destination,\" says Skene-Haygarth. \"I feel we're doing our part to make a real difference.\"\n\nShein confirmed only 8 per cent of the current Aralina collection is made from \"responsibly sourced\" fibres, primarily relating to viscose, which comes from \"verified responsible sourcing practices that minimise risk to ancient and endangered forests\". Shein aims to bring this to 20 per cent by the end of the year.\n\nThe rest of the collection is made from fibres such as polyester, with a few cotton and linen pieces. While viscose, or rayon, is derived from plant fibres, it is not inherently sustainable due to the significant consumption of water, energy and chemicals involved in its production, posing risks to workers and the environment.\n\nShein says while some viscose may be made in closed-loop systems (which minimise its environmental impact), it cannot provide details on what percentage of its viscose is produced this way - or provide total traceability for all of its fabrics.\n\nHolm is wary of \"conscious collections\" or phrases like \"responsible fibres\", which she says can be examples of greenwashing. \"These phrases are kind of thrown around, but what do they actually mean?\"\n\nQuaintance-James doesn't believe responsibly sourced materials or on-demand production can address the broader issue of hyper-consumption.\n\n\"Sustainability and ethics are inherently at odds with the ultra-fast fashion model, which prioritises speed, mass production and low costs over long-term environmental and social impacts,\" she says.\n\nIndeed, Holme says sustainability should be about fashion's entire life cycle. Last year, a report from The Australia Institute revealed Australia to be the world's biggest fashion consumers, with over 200,000 tonnes of clothing ending up in landfill each year. The Institute called for a change to our shopping habits, and the cheap, mass-produced clothing it said contributed to textile waste.\n\nSkene-Haygarth believes Aralina's pieces will stand the test of time.\n\n\"We have really focused on quality and not just disposable fashion,\" she says.\n\n\"We love detail and great workmanship ... I've got some [pieces] as well. I wear them. I love them, and it's not just single-use, it's something that I know I'll have in my wardrobe for a couple of years. So I don't feel like it's any different to purchasing anywhere else.\"",

            "title": "Jen Psaki, Stephen Colbert take aim at Schumer, blast Dems for relying on old tactics against Trump",
            "body": "MSNBC host Jen Psaki called out Democrats for relying on \"old tactics\" on Wednesday as late-night host Stephen Colbert and the MSNBC host took aim at Sen. Chuck Schumer for the \"strong letter\" he sent to President Donald Trump.\n\nMSNBC host Jen Psaki told CBS \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert on Wednesday that not enough Democrats were fighting back against President Donald Trump, as the two liberals mocked Sen. Chuck Schumer's efforts.\n\n\"I think what's pretty clear is not enough of them are fighting, far too many are still relying on the old tactics of ever lore,\" Psaki told Colbert before the late-night host quickly brought up Schumer.\n\n\"But Chuck Schumer, he wrote a very strong letter,\" he said. Psaki piled on and noted that it included, \"eight strongly worded questions.\"\n\nShe quipped, \"If that's not going to make you shake in your boots, I don't know what is.\"\n\nJEN PSAKI ADMITS MSNBC'S LIBERAL VIEWERS EXPECT NEGATIVE COVERAGE OF TRUMP\n\nSchumer touted sending the president a \"strong letter\" about Trump's government funding freeze at Harvard University, during a CNN interview on Sunday.\n\nPsaki praised Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's speech in New Hampshire on Sunday, calling it \"incredibly powerful and strong.\" In the speech, Pritzker called for mass protests against Trump.\n\nShe added that \"the message he was sending was, 'I'm a fighter, I'm going to say the things, I'm going to call out the do-nothing Democrats' - his word, not my words. He's going to call out what he's seeing in the Trump administration.\"\n\nPsaki continued, saying, \"I think what we are seeing right now is there is a divide, basically. There are people who are out there doing stuff, and by doing stuff I mean, it can be anything: go lead a protest, go to a red state, go hold a town hall, go to El Salvador. Whatever it may be, do stuff, people want to know you're fighting and doing things. If Democrats are going to rely on the tactics of old, they will lose.\"\n\n\"And so, hopefully more people come on to the fighting side,\" she added.\n\n'60 MINUTES' CALLS OUT CORPORATE OWNER PARAMOUNT ON THE AIR, SAYS PRODUCER WHO QUIT FELT INTERFERED WITH\n\nThe MSNBC host was also asked if journalists were \"caving to the pressure of the Trump administration,\" and denying the public truth.\n\n\"Yes, I mean, first of all, when you are picking out the AP and Bloomberg, I mean these are reporters who are asking things like 'what do you say about the bond market? What about these ceasefire negotiations?' They are not gotcha questions, they are there to cover the actual news, policymaking that is happening in the administration,\" she said, outlining her concerns.\n\n\"I've worked with media for more than two decades. Where the decisions are made are often behind the scenes, so there is no media organization or media outlet or reporter who is going to say, 'We are going to obey and advance now.' That's not how it's going to work.\"\n\nShe added, \"What happens is stories are killed, voices aren't invited on, stories are muted, they're watered down. We've obviously seen this happen recently, we don't know all the details behind the scenes with '60 Minutes,' but Bill Owens resigning is a significant statement of what they felt they were experiencing.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think most journalists are there to hold truth to power, to hold people to account, to follow the story, but where does the pressure come from at the top? And how do people respond to that? And how does that manifest itself in what news ends up on the front pages and on television? And those are pieces you will not see all of the behind-the-scenes conversations on,\" Psaki said.",

            "title": "Independents would push to end 'taboo' on tax reform in hung parliament",
            "body": "Several key independent MPs say if they are returned to parliament at May 3 and neither Labor nor the Coalition win an outright majority, they will seek a review of Australia's tax base through a \"broad-ranging\" process, saying the \"taboo\" on tax must end.\n\nIndependent MPs Allegra Spender, Kate Chaney, Zoe Daniel, Zali Steggall and Sophie Scamps have all named tax reform as an issue at the front of their priority list, with Australia's ageing working population posing a threat to future federal budgets.\n\nThat would include an honest review of current property investor subsidies of negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts.\n\nHowever, it may not necessarily be a bargaining chip in hung parliament negotiations, but rather an issue approached over the term.\n\nThe federal budget is expected to be in deficit for the next decade, which will require Australia to borrow more to fund the nation's services.\n\nBut credit rating agency Standard & Poor's is now warning that those deficit levels are putting Australia's gold standard AAA credit rating at risk -- and if deficits worsen due to election spending promises, it could force a downgrade in Australia's rating that would make paying down the nation's debt more expensive.\n\nIndependent MP Allegra Spender says she believes she has helped to create the space for MPs to discuss reform, but in the next term she will be \"expecting action as well as talk\".\n\n\"I want a broad ranging process to reform our tax system,\" Ms Spender said.\n\nThe Wentworth MP says momentum has built for reform since she entered parliament, and it has become a key issue in the dying days of the federal election campaign after S&P's warning.\n\nSeveral of the crossbenchers said the conversation must mature beyond kneejerk political reactions of talking about tax reform.\n\nCurtin independent MP Kate Chaney said that Australia's budgets were too dependent on income tax, and that would worsen as the working population ages.\n\n\"I've consistently said that tax reform shouldn't be taboo. We need to put everything on the table because right now Australia relies too heavily on personal income tax,\" Ms Chaney said.\n\n\"That's just not sustainable as our population ages. It's time to move beyond short-term fixes and start having honest conversations about long-term reforms that will set Australia up for the future.\"\n\nNegative gearing and CGT 'absolutely' part of good-faith review\n\nHowever, on one of the most contentious tax issues -- tax breaks for property investors -- both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton have already ruled out touching the settings of negative gearing or capital gains tax discounts.\n\nGoldstein MP Zoe Daniel says those property investor discounts would have to form part of any honest conversation.\n\n\"I think the first step is getting the review without any pre-conceived assumptions about what the review might yield,\" Ms Daniel said.\n\n\"But I also think any unintended consequences, or the full consequences of changing the system would have to be considered.\"\n\nMs Daniel noted that consequences for housing supply or self-funded retirees who have used investment properties as a form of superannuation would be among the concerns that would need to be investigated.\n\nWarringah MP Zali Steggall agreed that the budget burden of negative gearing and CGT merited review, but said the ultimate goal was to repair the budget's structural issues.\n\n\"The bigger question is reform around where the revenue base comes from, because at the moment we overwhelmingly rely on taxing individuals,\" Ms Steggall said.\n\nThe Warringah MP named subsidies offered to the \"fossil fuel\" resources sector as one area for attention, something also raised by Mackellar MP Sophie Scamps.\n\nMs Scamps said there was wide acceptance that parliament was \"well overdue for reform of our tax system as a whole\".\n\n\"We are too heavily reliant on personal income tax, yet derive very little tax revenue from the export of our resources. Productivity has stagnated for decades, small businesses are closing all across the country including in Mackellar, and young people are being left behind,\" Ms Scamps said.\n\n'Some level of acceptance on both sides'\n\nMs Steggall said she was open-minded about how reform could be approached, including whether it would be part of hung parliament discussions or something raised over the course of the next parliament -- saying that would have to depend on Saturday's result.\n\nThe independent added that depending on the size of the crossbench she expected a first priority for crossbenchers would be to come together collectively to assess priorities, and avoid being \"picked off\" individually by either of the major parties.\n\nMs Daniel agreed that the approach would depend on the makeup of the next parliament.\n\n\"It does depend to some degree on what the level of willingness or inclination within those initial conversations with both sides,\" she said.\n\n\"I sense some level of acceptance on both sides it might be good to do, much as the political risk for them is high, which is why it has been left to the crossbench to prosecute the reasons for an 'everything on the table' tax review.\"\n\nThe independents elected to parliament in the 2022 teal wave have reaffirmed they would be willing to support either Anthony Albanese or Peter Dutton to form government if a hung parliament is returned -- though the final seat result and therefore the ability of either Labor or the Coalition to run a \"stable government\" would influence who they would support.\n\nLack of nuclear detail a hurdle for several independents\n\nSeveral of the crossbenchers have also singled out the Coalition's nuclear policy as a hurdle to any offer of confidence and supply, questioning the party's commitment to a supposed signature policy.\n\nMs Daniel said there were still a number of holes in the detail.\n\n\"The thing with the nuclear plan is that it still feels sort of like a bit of a figment of the Coalition's imagination,\" Ms Daniel said.\n\nMs Scamps said in order to make any decisions in a minority government negotiation, she would want to see policies underpinned by evidence that parties had done \"the hard work\" in terms of modelling long-term impacts.\n\n\"Nuclear is a good example -- is that still Coalition policy, or not? Mr Dutton seems to have stopped talking about it,\" Ms Scamps said.\n\nMs Steggall said her questions came from a committee she sat on with now-Shadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien.\n\n\"Ironically at the time, the Coalition acknowledged large-scale nuclear was not feasible and should be ruled out, but left open the question of small modular reactors,\" Ms Steggall said.\n\nThe Warringah MP said nuclear could play a role for shifting the final 10 per cent of the electricity grid to renewables, but found it \"hard to fathom\" why the Coalition was ignoring its own findings from that nuclear inquiry.\n\nHung result unlikely to be repeat of 2010\n\nCrossbenchers previously told the ABC that if neither major party could win an outright majority in the lower house the minority government result would still look different to former prime minister Julia Gillard's 2010 minority government.\n\nVeteran independent MPs of that era, Andrew Wilkie and Bob Katter, both said a hung parliament result this time would not be a repeat of 2010 -- with both saying this time they would not be willing to sign formal governing agreements.\n\nMost of the crossbench has agreed they would not seek formal agreements and instead retain the ability to negotiate with the government bill by bill, supporting or opposing each on its merits.\n\nThe options for forming government could also be far simpler, depending on how many seats short of a majority either of the major parties fell.\n\nThe current crossbench is far larger than at any other point in parliament's modern history, and while not all of them may be returned, a prospective minority government could have many more options when negotiating with the crossbench than Ms Gillard and then-opposition leader Tony Abbott had in 2010.\n\nOnly former Liberal Ian Goodenough and independent Dai Le previously indicated to the ABC they would be open to striking formal agreements, though ex-Nationals MP Andrew Gee did not rule in or out whether he would be prepared to sign a binding agreement.\n\nThe Greens, who had four lower house MPs in the most recent parliament, have declared their desire to strike a formal agreement with Labor if it fell into minority -- though Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has ruled out the prospect of a formal deal with the minor party.",

            "body": "Jodie Sweetin and Candace Cameron Bure in a feud? Cut it out!\n\nThere is no bad blood between the \"Full House\" stars, who played sisters DJ and Stephanie Tanner, respectively, on the ABC sitcom that ran for eight seasons from 1987 to 1995.\n\nLast summer, Sweetin, 43, and Bure, 49, had different opinions over the Paris Olympics -- with \"The Jane Mysteries\" star calling out conservatives for their harsh opinions on the opening ceremony, which featured drag queens.\n\nBure dubbed the number, which referenced Leonardo Da Vinci's \"The Last Supper,\" \"disgusting\" and said it was mocking \"the Christian faith.\"\n\nDespite their dueling feelings, Sweetin set the record straight on where she stands with her on-screen sibling.\n\n\"Tell us you don't know about art,'\" host Amir Yass said on the latest episode of his \"The Vault\" podcast, quoting Sweetin. \"You were speaking about her...\"\n\nThe \"How Rude, Tanneritos!\" podcast host quickly clarified: \"To be honest, I wasn't speaking about her.\"\n\n\"There was already something that had happened where we went on a divergent path,\" explained Sweetin. \"And then I saw the Olympics thing and how people were freaking out about it, so I said, 'Oh my God, tell me you don't know anything about art history without telling me you know nothing,' and everyone was like, 'She came for Candace!'\"\n\nThe \"Fuller House\" star admitted she was shocked by that rumor.\n\nSweetin recalled, \"And I was like, 'What the...?' I was, like, getting a massage or something, and I came out to all of this, and I was like, 'What did I...? Oh, she said....ohhhhhh. Well, I guess that's it!'\"\n\n\"I'm not changing anything I said,\" she insisted. \"But it was not an intentional dig. But it was still what I wanted to say.\"\n\n\"It's funny, we've never actually 'gotten into it',\" she said. \"She posted her viewpoint and I posted mine, and we've always been very different on those things. I think it was just... now all of that comes to the surface more.\"\n\nThe \"Full House\" cast -- which also included the late Bob Saget, Lori Loughlin, John Stamos, Dave Coulier, Andrea Barber and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen -- have always been close.\n\nMost of the main cast, minus the Olsen twins, reunited for five seasons of Netflix's \"Fuller House\" from 2016-2020.\n\n\"Candace and I have just lived very different...lifestyles,\" Sweetin expressed. \"We just exist in different worlds, but she is still someone I have known since I was 5 years old.\"\n\n\"It's like family members,\" she added. \"Maybe we don't talk all the time, and I know if politics comes up it is not going to go well, but I don't hate you. I am not going to not hug you, but I'm also not going to not keep my mouth shut. So that's what I did. That's how I look at it. You don't want to follow or whatever, that's cool.\"\n\nAs Sweetin put it, \"I'll be nice, but I will not be quiet.\"\n\nIn 2022, however, Bure unfollowed Sweetin on Instagram after the Hallmark star supported JoJo Siwa who criticized Bure's comments about Great American Family's programming showing traditional families.\n\nSweetin noted, \"I'm not gonna unfollow anybody!\"\n\n\"I don't live my life based on social media,\" she shared. \"I think it can be used for some great things, and I also think it can be really negative and full of a lot of shit, particularly these days.\"\n\n\"Unfollow me, don't follow, whatevs,\" Sweetin stated. \"People announce their departure. It's like, 'Cool, yeah, goodbye! You live in fucking Wyoming. I don't know you!' And if people I do know unfollow me because of what I passionately believe in, then we are just very different people.\"\n\nIn 2022, Bure defended herself and her network, which she is the CCO at, from the backlash about showing traditional marriage in her programming.\n\n\"All of you who know me, know beyond question that I have great love and affection for all people. It absolutely breaks my heart that anyone would ever think I intentionally would want to offend and hurt anyone,\" she told People. \"It saddens me that the media is often seeking to divide us, even around a subject as comforting and merry as Christmas movies. But, given the toxic climate in our culture right now, I shouldn't be surprised. We need Christmas more than ever.\"\n\nThe \"Ainsley McGregor Mysteries\" star also spoke about her faith, adding, \"I am a devoted Christian. Which means that I believe that every human being bears the image of God. Because of that, I am called to love all people, and I do. If you know me, you know that I am a person who loves fiercely and indiscriminately.\"",

Gov. Greg Abbott, R-Texas, wrote a letter to San Marcos Mayor Jane Hughson admonishing the City Council, which voted to bring the resolution to a formal vote on May 6.\n\nIn his letter, Abbott pointed out that while the council was considering a resolution for a \"permanent ceasefire in occupied Palestine,\" it had not done the same to condemn Hamas following the Oct. 7 massacre.\n\nUT AUSTIN ANTI-ISRAEL AGITATORS FREED AFTER GOVERNOR SAID THEY 'BELONG IN JAIL'\n\n\"Israel is a stalwart ally of the United States and a friend to Texas. I have repeatedly made clear that Texas will not tolerate antisemitism. Anti-Israel policies are anti-Texas policies,\" Abbott wrote.\n\nThe governor said he was \"proud\" to have signed a law banning Texas government entities from supporting efforts to boycott, divest from and sanction (BDS) Israel. The BDS movement argues that Israel should not receive financial support due to its actions in the Gaza Strip and the West Bank.\n\nABBOTT SIGNS EXECUTIVE ORDER TO CURB ANTISEMITISM ON TEXAS CAMPUSES, DEMANDS 'APPROPRIATE PUNISHMENTS'\n\nTexas law, specifically Code \u00a7 2271.002, states that government entities are prohibited from entering into a contract worth $100,000 or more without a written guarantee that the contracting entity does not boycott Israel. Under the law, \"boycott Israel\" is defined as \"refusing to deal with, terminating business activities with, or otherwise taking any action that is intended to penalize, inflict economic harm on, or limit commercial relations specifically with Israel...\" Government entities that violate the law put their funding at risk.\n\nAbbott wrote in his letter that his office had already begun \"reviewing active grants with San Marcos to determine whether the city has breached terms by falsely certifying compliance with Texas law.\" Additionally, he said that if the city moves to pass the resolution, his office would not enter into future grant agreements with the city and would terminate active grants.\n\nUT AUSTIN PROTESTS DESCEND INTO CHAOS, ANTI-ISRAEL STUDENTS YELL AT POLICE: 'PIGS GO HOME!'\n\nThe City Council agenda description of the April 15 discussion read: \"Hold a discussion regarding a possible resolution calling for the immediate and permanent ceasefire in occupied Palestine, an arms embargo on Israel, recognition of Palestinian sovereignty, and the protection of constitutional rights for all people under national and international law.\"\n\nSan Marcos City Council member Alyssa Garza, who apparently put the resolution on the agenda, spoke at the April 15 meeting, framing the resolution as a way to fight big government. Garza listed the ways in which she believes larger government entities are threatening smaller ones and insisted that Texans could not rely on the same government \"to stop a genocide.\"\n\n\"[It's] clear to me that when they fund bombs, but cut aid for housing and education and so on here, that's connected. When they silence protests here and crush dissent abroad, that's connected. When they defund local governments and nonprofits and they call us 'distractive' for standing up, that's absolutely connected,\" Garza said.\n\nGAZA CEASEFIRE NEGOTIATIONS SEEING 'SIGNIFICANT BREAKTHROUGH' IN CAIRO: SOURCES\n\nAnother council member, Amanda Rodriguez, said the resolution wasn't political, but rather a \"moral litmus test.\" She also described the war in Gaza as a \"genocide.\" Additionally, Rodriguez made a plea to Jews who did not attend the meeting because \"there has been such a conflation with this resolution being compared to antisemitism.\" As part of the plea, she then said, \"You cannot tell me that Judaism as a religion supports this.\"\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nIn just five days, the San Marcos City Council is set to vote on the resolution and if it passes, Abbott's office is expected to evaluate its grants to the city.\n\nHughson, Garza and Rodriguez have yet to respond to a Fox News Digital request for comment.",

            "body": "Neil Young is facing criticism for a new song he wrote about \"fascists\" buying Teslas.\n\nThe 79-year-old singer-songwriter debuted the song, reportedly titled \"Let's Roll Again,\" at the Light Up the Blue charity concert in Los Angeles over the weekend.\n\n\"If you're a fascist, get a Tesla / It's electric, it doesn't matter / If you're a Democrat, taste your freedom / Get whatever you want, taste your freedom,\" Young could be heard singing in clips circulating on social media.\n\n\"Come on Ford, come on GM / Come on Chrysler, let's roll again,\" the song continued. \"Build something special that people need / Build us a safe way for us to meet / Build something that won't kill our kids / Runs real clean.\"\n\n\"Come on America, let's get in the race / China's way ahead, they're making clean cars,\" Young sang.\n\nResponses on social media have been full of mockery.\n\n\"Neil Young waddling up to a mic like a deranged scarecrow, screeching out his geriatric fever dream of a protest song, is peak washed-up hippie cringe,\" one X user wrote. \"Neil, you sound like a college freshman who just discovered Reddit and thinks quoting China makes them deep...

This decline was driven in part by frequent protests over Musk working with President Donald Trump on the Department of Government Efficiency (DOGE) initiative.\n\nRecently, Young said he was afraid Trump wouldn't allow him back into the country after his upcoming European tour.\n\n\"When I go to play music in Europe, if I talk about Donald J.

            "title": "Several countries sending firefighting planes to Israel to help tackle major wildfire",
            "body": "JERUSALEM -- Several countries were sending firefighting aircraft to Israel on Thursday as crews battled for a second day to extinguish a wildfire that had shut down a major highway linking Tel Aviv and Jerusalem and sent drivers scrambling from their cars.\n\nThe fire broke out around midday in the hills outside Jerusalem on Wednesday, fueled by hot, dry conditions and fanned by strong winds that quickly whipped up the flames burning through pine forests. Several communities were evacuated as a precaution as the smoke turned the skies over Jerusalem gray. Many of the country's independence day celebrations were cancelled as security forces were diverted towards the fire.\n\nThe fire has burned about 5,000 acres (20 square kilometers) and is the most significant fire Israel has seen in the past decade, according to Tal Volvovitch, a spokesperson for Israel's fire and rescue authority. She said the fire has \"miraculously\" not damaged any homes.\n\nIsrael's fire and rescue authority warned the public to stay away from parks or forests, and to be exceptionally careful while lighting barbecues. Thursday is Israel's Independence Day, which is typically marked with large family cookouts in parks and forests.\n\nAt least 12 people were treated in hospitals on Wednesday, mainly due to smoke inhalation, while another 10 people were treated in the field, Magen David Adom Ambulance services said. Twenty firefighters have been lightly injured, Volvovitch said.\n\nItaly, Croatia, Spain, France, Ukraine, and Romania were sending planes to help battle the flames, while several other countries, including North Macedonia and Cyprus, were also sending water-dropping aircrafts. Israeli authorities said 10 firefighting planes were operating on Thursday morning, with another eight aircraft to arrive during the course of the day.\n\nIsrael's fire and rescue authority lifted the evacuation order on approximately a dozen towns in the Jerusalem hills on Thursday.\n\nThree Catholic religious communities who were forced to evacuate from their properties on Wednesday were also able to return on Thursday, said Farid Jubran, the spokesperson for the Latin Patriarchate. He said their agricultural lands, including vineyards and olive trees, suffered heavy damage, and some of the buildings were damaged. But there were no injuries, and historic churches were not affected.\n\nThe main highway linking Jerusalem to Tel Aviv reopened on Thursday, a day after the flames had encroached on the road, forcing drivers to abandon their cars and flee in terror. On Thursday morning, broad swathes of burned areas were visible from the highway, while pink anti-flame retardant dusted the top of burned trees and bushes. Smoke and the smell of fire hung heavy in the air.\n\nIsrael often sees fires in the summertime, but such strong fires this early in the year are unusual. Many of Israel's forests are planted rather than natural.\n\nOne of the organizations that manages Israel's' forests said that the fires had perfect conditions to spread: a winter with little rain, hot and dry weather, and exceptionally strong winds that are shifting direction constantly.\n\nAnat Gold, the director of Israel's central region for the Jewish National Fund, known by its Hebrew acronym KKL, which manages forests, plants trees, and promotes settlement in the Holy Land, said the fire was mostly contained. But she added that workers were struggling to plow buffer zones and fire breaks as the same spots ignited repeatedly in the quickly changing winds.\n\nGold said climate change, which has resulted in decreased rainfall in the region, contributed to the fire's ferocity. \"Of course when there's a series of drought years, it's a fertile ground for fires,\" she said.\n\nIn 2010, a massive forest fire burned for four days on northern Israel's Mount Carmel, claiming 44 lives and destroying around 12,000 acres, much of it woodland.",

            "title": "Freedom in an age of climate crisis and trade wars: Lessons from philosopher Immanuel Kant",
            "body": "A decade ago, the majority of nations committed to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, pledging to \"leave no one behind\" by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050.\n\nTen years on, the sentiment regarding such aspirations is skeptical and the mood gloomy. With the rise of autocracies and the influence of libertarian tech-billionaires on politics, goals such as development for all and climate neutrality seem to be relics of the past.\n\nThe United States, the most powerful country in the world, is at the heart of this shift. In 1776, the U.S. declared independence and was founded on the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness. Today, however, it is increasingly known for its disregard of life, legislative attacks on civil liberties and creating global insecurity through tariffs.\n\nIn the midst of all this, it's important to remember ours is not the first generation to face dark times. As my recent research argues, Immanuel Kant's philosophy can offer us valuable tools for navigating today's challenges.\n\nKant's vision of possible progress\n\nIn 1776, the same year the U.S. was founded, Kant was preparing his breakthrough critical philosophy and lecturing on freedom and pragmatic anthropology, all while living in the absolutist monarchy of Prussia.\n\nAt the time, Prussia was using its military to expand its territory and enforce internal colonization over land and peoples.\n\nAmid this, Kant observed the contradictions of human nature -- people who acted both good and bad, cruel and respectful of others -- and described humanity as \"crooked timber.\" Yet Kant insisted on viewing this \"crooked timber\" through the lens of freedom.\n\nAt the centre of Kant's universalist, freedom-focused vision for the future was the idea of a world where all people lived in dignity. It is focused on autonomy as the capacity to self-legislate. Freedom served as his North Star for what is today called \"backcasting,\" or thinking backward from a desired future to identify possible paths toward achieving it.\n\nRead more: Explainer: the ideas of Kant\n\nIn this spirit, Kant observed the rise of competitive markets that rewarded selfishness and greed, and argued that law and international co-operation -- what he called a federation of republics -- could turn antagonism into springs of progress. In other words, he analyzed the discord and conflict of his present for signs of possible progress.\n\nCrucial for the identification of such possibilities was the freedom of public reason: people thinking for themselves and contributing to public debate.\n\nThinking long-term about freedom\n\nWhat can we learn from Kant about navigating today's multiple crises?\n\nFirst, focus on freedom from a long-term perspective. The current trade war will likely reduce economic growth, but they may also advance the re-regionalization of economies -- an idea long supported by post-growth economists seeking sustainable prosperity.\n\nHowever, regional production is not inherently good. Rather, we need a public discussion about which essential goods -- food, for example -- are best mostly supplied regionally, by whom and where international co-operation is called for.\n\nThe climate crisis requires plans not fixes\n\nSecond, Kant's insights remind us that freedom must be pursued within the reality of a shared, finite planet. Climate change is not a problem that can be solved overnight. Emissions don't care about the threats and angry fits of autocrats. It's a global, complex challenge that requires long-term planning processes.\n\nThere are signs of progress in this regard: in 2024, the United Kingdom reported greenhouse gas emissions to be at their lowest levels since 1872 thanks to long-term planning. Canada, after opting out of the Kyoto Protocol in 2011, finally saw emissions start to fall in 2025 following a renewed commitment to international climate goals and planning.\n\nBut this progress is fragile. The chaos of Trump's tariff wars must not lead our politicians and policymakers to prioritize short-term economic and political gains over long-term climate strategies.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's support for pipelines, for instance, is at odds with evidence that fossil fuel expansion will lock in emissions.\n\nIt also diverts public money away from cheaper sources of renewable energy and supporting citizens through a just energy transition. With trade wars and economic insecurity, inflation will likely increase costs of living. This will hit poorer households harder, making this a matter of both environmental and social justice.\n\nRebuilding the public sphere\n\nThird, for Kant, current lifestyle expectations are no guide for the core of future freedom. So if the American treasury secretary asserts that \"cheap goods are not part of the American dream,\" can we, paradoxically, detect an unexpected sign of possible progress?\n\nThe answer is yes -- if we take that example as evidence that worthwhile aspirations cannot be captured by consumerism but call for a more sustained effort.\n\nWhile modern consumers are willing to make big efforts -- such as for daily gym and running routines -- can similar energy be released to collective dreams of progress and saving the planet? For Kant, future freedom requires seeing beyond individual to collective aspirations. This relies on shared goals that can be articulated through foresight and supported by a vibrant, critical public sphere.\n\nIn Kant's time, the public sphere mainly consisted of the Republic of Letters, a network made of intellectuals and writers in the late 17th and 18th centuries engaging in open debate.\n\nToday, by contrast, much of our communication takes place on social media platforms that prioritize short-form formats, reward anger over analysis and are owned by a few global corporations structured to maximize profits rather than the quality of public deliberation. To counter this trend, regionally diverse, independent news providers are needed along with decentralized, open source social media.\n\nBut above all, in an era of climate crisis, political polarization and economic instability, Kant reminds us of what he called a \"Denkungsart:\" an \"art of thinking\" or mindset based on freedom and possibility in a long-term perspective.",

Those moves were advanced enough that the board chose a single head hunting firm for the search.\n\nMr Musk, who owns 13 per cent of Tesla, appeared to get the message, telling investors that \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla\".\n\nThe threat to remove Mr Musk now appears to have dissipated.\n\nTesla, Musk deny reports\n\nBoth Tesla and its CEO have hit back at the reports.\n\n\"It is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the WSJ would publish a deliberately false article and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors!\" wrote Mr Musk on X.\n\nTesla board chair Robyn Denholm also chimed in.\n\n\"Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,\" he stated.\n\n\"This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).\n\n\"The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.\"\n\n\"Tesla was given the opportunity to provide a statement before publication, which they did not do.\"\n\nOriginally published as 'Better off': Claims Tesla looked to replace Elon Musk",

She is the bookies' short-priced favourite at $1.03.\n\nFirst elected in 2013, Ms Price has spent 12 years in Federal politics, serving both in Government and in Opposition during that time.\n\nThroughout that time, she has held ministerial portfolios, including the environment, defence industry, and science and technology at different times.\n\nLabor's Karen Wheatland is the main candidate in Ms Price's way, as she looks to make an impression on the region as her father Ian did.\n\nMs Wheatland said her father had been an inspiration, she and was hoping to do him proud throughout the campaign.\n\nThe late Mr Wheatland was a real estate agent and property developer who helped shape Geraldton.\n\nShe said she considered herself an underdog, but you could \"never say never\".\n\nOther parties have also made their presence known, with Nationals candidate Bailey Kempton and Greens candidate Brendan Sturcke seen in Geraldton in a bid to win votes.\n\nMr Kempton, who runs a local electrician business, hoped the momentum created from the strong Nationals result in regional WA would help his campaign.\n\nMr Sturcke, who is Perth-based, travelled to the electorate for the campaign, and has made his way further north to reach more people and have discussions about climate change.\n\nThe other candidates who have put their hand up for the Durack seat are Kat Wright (Legalise Cannabis), Mark Berry (One Nation), Jason Hunter (Indigenous - Aboriginal Party of Australia), Maarten Kornaat (Trumpet of Patriots), and Eugenie Harris (Australian Christians).\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

            "body": "Federal election 2025: The key seats that could decide the next governmentEllen RansleyThe NightlyFri, 2 May 2025 2:00AMCommentsCommentsEmail Ellen Ransley\n\nThis Saturday's election is shaping up to produce a m\u00e9lange of results. All the polls say Labor is almost certain to retain Government, it will just be a matter of whether they cling on to majority, or fall short - and if so, by how much.\n\nGoing into the election, Labor holds a notional 78 seats, the Coalition 57, the Greens 4, and the crossbench 11. The major parties need 76 of the 150 seats to form majority Government, but could govern with 75 by making a crossbencher the speaker.\n\nA handful of marginal seats could swap hands, while there are serious challenges to electorates with more sizeable buffers. The teal wave that swept through capital cities in 2022 could extend into the regions this time, while the Greens face tough competition in their three Queensland seats, and One Nation's vote is up across tehc ountry.\n\nPsephologist Kevin Bonham told The Nightly said there were about 50 seats to pay close attention to - including most marginal seats on either side.\n\n\"If the polls are right, the median result is Labor slightly increasing its majority. There could reasonably be anything from Labor falls into minority by a few through to something lopsided - anything within that range,\" he said.\n\n\"For Labor to fall deeply into minority, something would be deeply wrong... But you can't be absolutely sure until you see what happens.\"\n\nFeel like giving the politicians a rating this Federal election?\n\nOur Pollie Rater lets you do just that.\n\nRate the politicians\n\nLiberal sources know there's a reality where they only win five or six seats come Saturday but are still hopeful a significant Labor backlash eventuates in the outer urban electorates.\n\nLabor MPs and staffers alike are still nervous, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is hopeful he doesn't just hold his majority, but increases it.\n\n\"We're aiming to hold every single one of them, and we're out there campaigning hard in Coalition-held seats and in Greens-held seats as well,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nPollsters, strategists and party sources alike say there are very few guarantees in this election -- Saturday will essentially be \"150 byelections\" but these are about 40 of the key ones to watch.\n\nVictoria\n\nOf the state's 38 seats, a handful could change hands on Saturday night. The unpopular state Government has been a drag on federal Labor's vote, but they're hopeful the outer-suburban wipeout the Coalition had been hoping for doesn't eventuate.\n\nThe Liberals have made no secret of their aspiration to pinch Chisholm back from the Labor Party, while Aston -- which was won by the Government in the 2023 byelection on a fluke -- will inevitably change hands. \"We're not supposed to have it,\" one Labor source said.\n\nMcEwan, in the city's north, is held by Labor with 3.8 per cent. Dutton has now visited the seat three times this campaign and is firming up to be one of Labor's losses. Dunkley, in the city's east is another one of those outer-metropolitan/ peri urban seats where the cost-of-living factor could go against Labor's 6.8 per cent margin.\n\nThe safe Labor seat of Gorton, held with 10 per cent, became the centre of a concerted Coalition advertising campaign mid-way through the campaign. Labor could suffer a significant swing here, but party insiders believe it will hold. They share the same view about Hawke (7.6 per cent), which Mr Dutton has now visited twice in five weeks to Mr Albanese's zero.\n\nMeanwhile in Bendigo, the Nationals are in with a strong chance of decimating Labor's 11.2 per cent margin to add it to its column.\n\nLabor is also fighting on its left flank, with the Greens running strong races in Wills and Macnamarra -- where preference flows will be crucial. The minor party are most confident about knocking Wills MP Peter Khalil off.\n\nLabor could recover some of their losses by picking up Deakin, which is held by the Liberals on 0.02 per cent.\n\nLiberal sources believe they will pick up either Goldstein or Kooyong from the teal independents. Former MP Tim Wilson is running a strong campaign in the former, and Mr Dutton spent time with candidate Amelia Hammer in Kooyong this week to throw his support behind her.\n\nBut the Coalition could lose Dan Tehan's regional seat of Wannon to Climate-200 backed candidate Alex Dyson.\n\nNSW\n\nThe Coalition is most confident of its chances in picking up the Labor-held seat of Gilmore, where former state MP Andrew Constance is again taking on Fiona Phillips' wafer thin 0.2 per cent margin.\n\nIn Sydney, the redistribution has reverted Labor-held Bennelong - the seat of former PM John Howard - back to the Liberals. Mr Albanese visited the electorate on Monday to hand out how-to-vote cards with incumbent MP Jerome Laxale, and Labor sources acknowledge the seat will be a tough fight - but are hopeful it will hold.\n\nThe Liberals have made some noise about Labor-held Reid, Parramatta, and Werriwa. Werriwa appears the most likely to change hands, if the outer-suburban swing away from Labor manifests, and dependent on how the third-party vote pans out.\n\nOut in the city's west, Labor is pouring resources into Fowler, where independent Dai Le won by 1.1 per cent in 2022 following a disastrous decision by Labor to parachute in senator Kristina Kenneally. This time, they've backed in Tu Le, and Mr Albanese received a warm reception during a streetwalk earlier this week.\n\nBoth Mr Dutton and Mr Albanese stopped in the country's bellwether seat of Robertson on the same day this week. Both parties say they are confident in this central coast seat - but whatever happens here has for 15 elections been a reflection of the national mood.\n\nBradfield, which has been a blue-ribbon seat since its creation in 1972, has captured some of the independent voters from the abolished electorate of North Sydney, and the Liberal's margin has been reduced to a narrow 2.5 per cent. With Paul Fletcher retiring, there's a strong belief well-financed independent Nicolette Boele could win the seat on her second tilt.\n\nOf the other blue-ribbon seats that went teal in 2022, Mackellar - held by Sophie Scamps - is discussed as the most likely to revert.\n\nIn the regions, Calare will make for a fascinating watch where a three-way competition between the Nationals, party defector and incumbent Andrew Gee, and a Climate-200 backed independent.\n\nIn Cowper, where independent Caz Jeise shaved off almost 10 per cent of Nationals MP Pat Conaghan's margin in 2022, Coalition sources acknowledge they face a serious threat.\n\nQueensland\n\nThe Sunshine State offers Labor the most chances for gains. Greens-held Brisbane will be a three-way contest, and it could go to either Labor or the Liberal Party, depending on preferences. If Labor's Madonna Jarrett can finish second ahead of incumbent Stephen Bates, she can clinch the seat on preferences.\n\nThe Coalition feels more confident in wresting Ryan back from the Greens.\n\nGriffith, Kevin Rudd's old seat, will be another fierce contest against Greens' MP Max Chandler-Mather. Mr Albanese visited the seat on Tuesday, and Labor sources acknowledge it will be difficult - less of a sure bet, but possible.\n\nThe bayside seat of Bonner has been in Coalition hands since 2010, but as Labor has improved in national polling this electorate has emerged as a must-watch seat with Mr Albanese visiting the seat on Tuesday. In Leichhardt in the state's north, candidate Matt Smith has had plenty of frontbench support in the last five weeks and a strong advertising campaign behind him.\n\nMr Dutton's seat of Dickson, which he holds with a slim 1.7 per cent margin, could provide a fascinating result. Labor's Ali France is running for a third time, and it was the first stop on Mr Albanese's campaign. The emergence of a Climate 200-backed candidate who hails from a Liberal-supporting part of the electorate has Mr Dutton vulnerable in his own backyard.\n\nClimate-200 independents are running strong in the regional electorate of Groom, which has emerged as a dark horse, as well as the Gold Coast seat of McPherson. While the Coalition has buffers of 6.9 per cent and 9.3 per cent respectively, there's an outside chance of some movement.\n\nTasmania\n\nFour of the apple isle's five seats are under the spotlight this election. Labor believe they have a chance of flipping Bass and/ or Braddon, on margins of 1.4 per cent and eight per cent respectively. The Liberals have thrown a lot of resources at taking Lyons from Labor, with Mr Dutton making his fifth visit this campaign on Thursday.\n\nThe safe Labor seat of Franklin, held by minister Julie Collins on 13.7 per cent, is on the wildcard list. Solidly Labor since 1993, the salmon farming issue has become potent in the electorate and independent Peter George, backed by Climate 200, has run a highly visible and well-funded campaign.\n\nWA\n\nLabor is in a good position to hold all nine of its seats in WA, including Tangney. The new electorate of Bullwinkel, which is notionally Labor, is favoured by the Liberals.\n\nThe Liberals are confident the affluent blue-ribbon seat of Curtin, which went teal in 2022, will return to them. But they could lose the regional seat of Forrest, where Climate-200 backed Sue Chapman has run a strong campaign and could pinch the seat from the Liberals after 53 years.\n\nSA\n\nThe suburban seat of Sturt is a three-cornered race, where Liberal MP James Stevens faces a tough battle against Labor and a new independent challenger. The Greens picked up 16 per cent of the vote last time, so any increase to that vote, as well as preference flows from the independent, could put this seat in Labor's hands.\n\nLabor could lose nearby Boothby, where former MP Nicolle Flint is taking on the Labor incumbent. Liberals are confident her name recognition will help them.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

            "body": "2025 Federal election: Durack candidates have their final say ahead of polls on SaturdayMatthew PaddickGeraldton GuardianFri, 2 May 2025 2:00AM\n\nAhead of the 2025 Federal election on Saturday, the Geraldton Guardian reached out to the nine candidates in the Durack electorate so they could deliver their final pitch to voters.\n\nHere's what they had to say on why they deserve your vote, in order of how they appear on the ballot.\n\nMelissa Price (Liberal)\n\nI've had the privilege of representing Durack since 2013. Over the past 12 years, I've worked hard to deliver the infrastructure and services our vast electorate deserves -- better roads, mobile coverage, NBN upgrades, and support for local mining and council projects.\n\nI am proud of the Liberal Party's strong commitment to mental health, including new headspace centres across Durack, which are making a real difference for young people and families.\n\nFeel like giving the politicians a rating this Federal election?\n\nOur Pollie Rater lets you do just that.\n\nRate the politicians\n\nOne of my proudest achievements is helping establish the Pilbara Kimberley University Centre, which is transforming access to regional education and workforce development.\n\nMy team and I have helped thousands of constituents resolve complex issues with Centrelink, the NDIS, veterans services and immigration. We live here, we understand the challenges, and we care deeply about the people we serve.\n\nThis Saturday, I ask for your support to continue delivering for Durack with experience, energy and determination and a Liberal government ready to get Australia back on track.\n\nKat Wright (Legalise Cannabis)\n\nLisa Simpson once said: \"The whole damn system is wrong.\" And let's be honest -- she's right.\n\nIn Durack and across regional Australia, people are doing it tough while the same old systems protect the few and leave the rest of us behind. Whether it's housing, jobs, farming, or climate -- what we have isn't working. It's time for a reset.\n\nThat's why I'm running for the Legalise Cannabis Party -- not just to legalise hemp, but to use it to build something better. Hemp can power real, grassroots reform: affordable housing made from hempcrete, jobs in regional processing, regenerative farming that heals our land, and a circular economy where waste becomes opportunity.\n\nThis isn't a pipedream -- it's a practical, profitable and sustainable path forward that starts right here in Durack.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr warned us against political apathy when he said: \"If you fail to act now, history will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clammer of the bad people but the appalling silence of the good people.\"\n\nI won't be silent. I will stand up because our system needs fixing.\n\nTogether we can overGROW the government.\n\nBailey Kempton (Nationals)\n\nDuring the aftermath of cyclone Seroja, I witnessed the neglect that regional people face even during crises. In Durack, we work hard, and we love where we live, but we get only a fraction back of what we contribute to the nation's economy. We're being let down by the Government, and we need a different approach.\n\nWe deserve access to quality health care, education and to travel on well-maintained roads. It's clear that families are struggling with the cost of living and need real action that will help their back pocket now, not in 15 months. By halving fuel excise, we will provide immediate relief to those who need it most.\n\nI decided to run for politics after becoming tired of watching these issues persist without change. The current Government seems unconcerned about the opinions of Australians, especially those outside the city. This is confirmed through recent remarks by a senior Labor member about the Voice being inevitable, despite the referendum result.\n\nMy campaign has been about stepping up, engaging with the community, hearing your concerns and offering a different choice. Durack needs someone with common sense who won't back down in the fight because where we live is worth fighting for.\n\nMark Berry (One Nation)\n\nDurack stands at a crossroads. We can stick with the same failed policies that have made life harder, or we can choose a new path -- one that puts everyday Australians first.\n\nFor too long, both major parties have put ideology ahead of common sense. They've driven up the cost of living, neglected essential services and allowed our freedoms to erode. That must end.\n\nAs your One Nation candidate, I won't make empty promises. I will fight to reduce the tax burden on working Australians and eliminate billions in government waste. I stand for real reform -- not more bureaucracy.\n\nFreedom of speech must be protected. It's a cornerstone of our democracy, and I will work to enshrine it in our Constitution. The major parties won't defend this right -- but I will.\n\nAs a proud Australian Army veteran, I served this country to protect our values. I won't stand by while they're stripped away.\n\nThis election is about reclaiming our voice, restoring our freedoms and building a fairer future for all Australians. With your support and trust, we can lead that change -- together.\n\nJason Hunter (Indigenous -- Aboriginal Party of Australia)\n\nAs a Nykina man, I'm running to finally put First Nations voices at the heart of Durack's future.\n\nFor too long, our communities have been sidelined while politicians treat Indigenous issues as political wedges.\n\nMy first priority is protecting the Martuwarra (Fitzroy River) and all our precious waterways from fracking and over-extraction, respecting 60,000 years of Indigenous water stewardship that major parties continue to ignore.\n\nThe cost-of-living crisis demands more than temporary rebates. I'll fight to break the Coles/Woolworths duopoly through enforced ACCC reforms and invest in regional food security projects to actually lower prices at the checkout. Unlike the majors who protect mining profits, I'll make corporations pay their fair share to fund lasting solutions.\n\nOn housing, I'll push to tax vacant properties, cap investor tax perks, and expand safe caravan park spaces for those struggling to find homes. For health care, we'll clean contaminated water supplies and replace punitive approaches with proper mental health support and preventative care focused on nutrition and healthy living.\n\nDurack deserves an economy beyond mining booms. I'll champion sustainable industries like hemp and renewables, fight to keep rural hospitals open, and create Indigenous-led housing and education programs with real job pathways.\n\nHealing country begins when traditional knowledge guides decision-making. After generations of empty promises, I'll bring that change to Canberra.\n\nMaarten Kornaat (Trumpet of Patriots)\n\nPutting Australians First.\n\nI will fight to ease the cost of living by introducing a 15 per cent iron ore mining levy, with proceeds used to reduce national debt and raise the tax-free income threshold. Education must be a right, not a burden -- university will be free for Australian citizens, and all HECS debts will be forgiven.\n\nGovernment waste will be addressed through a full audit, with spending redirected to benefit Australian citizens and interests.\n\nI will fight to restore freedom by reducing government overreach, eliminating red tape, and empowering individuals and small businesses, especially in regional areas. Farmers must be free to farm, and doctors free to heal patients without interference.\n\nA royal commission into the government's COVID-19 response will be launched to identify failings, ensure accountability and learnings will be implemented to protect our rights.\n\nAustralia's sovereignty comes first. I will review all international memberships, including with the WEF (World Economic Forum) and WHO, to ensure they align with national interests. All public-private partnerships will be audited to guarantee they serve the Australian people -- not foreign or corporate agendas.\n\nI will be listening to and addressing the concerns of the people of Durack.\n\nLet's shape the future of Australia together!\n\nKaren Wheatland (Labor)\n\nI'm running because Durack deserves better -- better health care, better jobs and a future our kids can actually afford.\n\nReal change doesn't happen from the sidelines. It happens when you're in the room, helping to make the decisions that matter.\n\nVoting Labor is the best way to get things done -- on cost of living, climate, housing, health care -- all the everyday big stuff.\n\nThe Albanese Labor Government has a real plan to deliver cost-of-living relief, build more things right here, and make housing more accessible.\n\nLabor's already delivering -- from Medicare Urgent Care Clinics to major road upgrades -- and I want to keep Durack moving forward, not backwards under Peter Dutton.\n\nI've lived the life so many in Durack are living right now. I've worked the boats, raised my kids on my own, and fought hard to survive each day.\n\nI know what it's like to be stretched, doing your best, and still turning up. That's the kind of representative I'll be -- someone who shows up, fights smart, and never forgets where they came from.\n\nDurack deserves someone who gets it. I do. And I'm ready to get to work.\n\nBrendan Sturcke (Greens)\n\nDurack is a remarkable electorate, my time as a farmhand and in the mining industry has created deep ties with the area and I'm excited to be able to offer people the opportunity to vote for real change.\n\nWe know farmers and fishers are some of the most affected by the climate crisis and supermarket price gouging, which is why we're pushing for stronger climate action and strengthening protections like making the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct mandatory.\n\nAs I've travelled across the electorate, the overwhelming feedback I've been receiving is people are feeling abandoned by the Government.\n\nWe know local communities have the answers to the problems they're facing, we need to be listening and working with people on the ground to find meaningful solutions.\n\nNow isn't the time to be tinkering around the edges, the majority of people are struggling with housing, cost of living, and health and the Government must act.\n\nThe Greens are the only party taking real action on the climate and cost-of-living crises.\n\nThis election is a pivotal moment in history, not only for the planet but also the people of Durack. Nothing changes if you don't vote for it.\n\nAustralian Christians candidate Eugenie Harris did not respond to the Geraldton Guardian's request for comment.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

Another jockey who has proven his worth this season on the Geraldton track is Austin Galati, who will be racing with trainer Kevin Mahoney on Kentucky Blue out of barrier two.\n\nEntry is free, with the gates opening at noon on Sunday.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

            "title": "Scenes from a Repatriation review - 12 ingenious questions about cultural ownership",
            "body": "Royal Court theatre, London\n\nSingaporean Joel Tan's play revolves around the fate of an ancient statue, in disparate scenes of thrilling complexity played by a zesty cast\n\nControversies over statues of cultural figureheads have churned in the news in recent years. The repatriation of a fictional 12th-century statue of a Chinese deity, carved in stone, forms the central dispute in Singaporean Joel Tan's play.\n\nThe Bodhisattva Guanyin reclines in the \"royal ease\" pose at one end of a traverse stage, designed by TK Hay, with a combination of screens and mirrors. The drama is formed of 12 distinct scenes, loosely connected around the statue. It begins choppily inside the British Museum with patronising or incendiary debate by protesters and curators, sometimes set beside flashes of 19th-century imperial history. The tone switches from serious-minded to satirical to gnomic.\n\nBut its disparate parts coalesce and gather intellectual complexity as well as dramatic intensity, all enacted with zest by a six-strong cast: Kaja Chan, Aidan Cheng, Jon Chew, Fiona Hampton, Robin Khor Yong Kuan and Sky Yang. There is playful yet disciplined direction by experimentalists emma + pj, with actors using the auditorium in original yet unmessy ways.\n\nWe travel from protests in London, inside and outside the museum, to a Chinese detention centre, Shanghai Pudong airport and a splashy Beijing party thrown by the industrialist who secures the return of the statue.\n\nAn overseas Chinese student protester confronting his British tutor opens up ideas on identity, covert racism and art - a statue can be in exile like a refugee, says the student. A Chinese official interrogating a cartoonist offers new dimensions to cultural appropriation and artistic protest. The Beijing party brings troubling patriotism and anti-western contempt that intersects with shocking misogyny. These scenes are relatively brief but contain real depth of thought. Neither are they bluntly polemical but wrapped within character and incident.\n\n\"All of human history is basically people taking things from each other,\" someone says. It does not seem to be an argument for leaving, for example, the Parthenon marbles in the British Museum, but the play cleverly muddies the idea of provenance and ownership. A character states that the Bodhisattva Guanyin is not even a Chinese figure but is in fact Indian.\n\nThe play's various scenarios complicate the debate and lay bare the politics of repatriation. The Chinese magnate who virtually bribes the museum into returning the statue places it in Shanghai's airport so that the deity is turned into a symbol of power - and the rise and fall of empires.\n\nThe Bodhisattva herself presides over all of it, watching over centuries of history, but the statue remains wrapped throughout. This obfuscation is puzzling - yet another one of the play's interesting ideas. This is innovative theatre, shining with intelligence, which brings richness to our cultural tussle with the problem of ancient statues and their rightful place in the world.",

The aim is to streamline regulations for developers so they can speed up their projects and the Labour government can meet its target for delivering 1.5m new homes by the end of this parliament in 2029.\n\nThe poorest rural communities, who often live in areas badly served by public transport, may lose their access to green space under this bill, campaigners have said.\n\nAli Plummer, director of policy and advocacy at Wildlife and Countryside Link, said: \"Leaving it on a wing and a prayer that loss of nature locally won't be offset into potentially another county does not give the certainty and safeguards that local people and the local environment need.\n\n\"A third of communities around the country already have little or no access to nature locally, contributing to the likelihood of poorer mental and physical health.\"\n\nParks in poorer parts of England are less likely to be protected against being built on than those in more affluent areas, and 2.8 million people in the UK live more than 10 minutes walk from a public park, garden or playing field.\n\nDefra sources said ideally lost nature and green space would be as close as possible to where it used to be, but this would not always be feasible and there was no provision in the bill to ensure it would be recreated nearby.\n\nNature experts have said the bill is \"one-sided\" and could allow developers to ignore environmental protections, as well as creating a \"cash to trash nature\" system. This is because it allows developers to pay into a nature restoration fund rather than ensuring they protect wildlife on the site they are building on. The Guardian also recently reported that thousands of playing fields could be lost to housing if the bill goes ahead unamended.\n\nZack Polanski, deputy leader of the Green party, said: \"We live in one of the most nature depleted countries in the world ... It's appalling that the government hasn't thought through the consequences of destroying habitats as they're so eager to please huge developers at all costs.\n\n\"We have a housing crisis and desperately need homes. The government must ensure that communities, especially our poorest communities who are least likely to be well represented in this debate, have access to local green space.\"\n\nPlummer said: \"Reduced local tree cover and other natural solutions also leaves communities less resilient to more extreme weather conditions as the climate changes. Urgent changes to the planning bill are needed to guarantee developments avoid harm wherever possible, guarantee local nature loss is more than compensated for locally, and ensure that the nature restoration fund follows the science on what will work for nature and neighbourhoods.\"",

            "title": "In this Indian city, smartwatches are part of the solution to dealing with searing heat",
            "body": "AHMEDABAD, India -- It's a little past 10 a.m. and the heat is already blazing on the outskirts of the Western Indian city of Ahmedabad.\n\nSapnaben Chunara, a 30-year-old mother of three, has just finished her morning chores. She seeks respite from the heat in the shade of a neem tree, a species that can withstand high temperatures and drought.\n\nChunara spends most of the day outdoors in Vanzara Vas, a low-income neighborhood of about 800 families, because her tin-roofed house is even hotter. Indoor temperatures can be even higher, especially when outside they climb above 40 degrees Celsius (104 F).\n\nThat was once rare but now happens regularly. And this year, high heat started three weeks earlier than in previous years, touching 43 degrees Celsius (109.40 F) in early April.\n\n\"Sometimes it gets so hot, I can't think straight,\" said Chunara, sporting a black smartwatch that contrasts sharply with her colorful bangles and sari.\n\nChunara is one of 204 residents of Vanzara Vas given the smartwatches for a year-long study to find out how heat affects vulnerable communities around the world. The watches measure heart rate and pulse and track sleep, and participants get weekly blood pressure checks.\n\nResearchers also painted some roofs with reflective paint to reduce indoor heat and will compare them to homes without so-called cool roofs using indoor heat sensors. Along with the smartwatches, this will help them understand how much cool roofs can help poor households deal with India's scorching summers.\n\nChunara, whose home didn't get a cool roof, said she's happy to participate by wearing the watch, confident the results will help her family, too.\n\n\"They might paint my roof as well and they might be able to do something that helps all of us in this area cope with the heat better,\" Chunara said.\n\nCities like Ahmedabad have always had hot summers, but now they're nearing the threshold beyond which exposure for more than a few hours can be fatal.\n\nIn the summer of 2010, the city witnessed nearly 1,300 excess deaths - how many more people died than would be expected - which experts found were most likely due to high temperatures.\n\nAn increasingly hot planet, due largely to burning fossil fuels such as coal and gas that release carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases, means already hot regions are getting even worse.\n\nA 2023 study estimated that if the global mean temperature continues to rise to just under 2 degrees Celsius (3.6 degrees Fahrenheit), there would be a 370% rise in heat-related deaths around the world and most would happen in South and Southeast Asia and Africa.\n\n\"This is a big concern, and it also shows the heat divide\" between the poor and wealthy, said Abhiyant Tiwari, a climate expert with NRDC India and part of the group conducting the research in Ahmedabad.\n\nFollowing the 2010 tragedy, city officials, with help from public health and heat experts, devised an action plan to warn citizens when the heat is at dangerous levels and prepare city hospitals to respond rapidly to heat-related illness. The plan has been replicated across India and other parts of South Asia.\n\nThe last two years have been the world's hottest ever, and researchers hope their work can provide an additional line of defense for those who bear the brunt of increasing heat.\n\nThe Ahmedabad study is only one part of a global research project examining how heat is affecting poor, vulnerable communities in four cities across the world. Researchers also are measuring heat impacts using smartwatches and other devices in Africa's Burkina Faso, the Pacific island of Niue near New Zealand and in the Sonoran desert region in Mexico.\n\nMore than 1.1 billion people - about one-eighth of the world's population - live in informal settlements and poor neighborhoods that are particularly vulnerable, said Aditi Bunker, environmental health researcher associated with the University of Auckland, New Zealand, and Heidelberg University, Germany, who is leading the global project.\n\n\"Climate change and heat are ravaging populations. And now the question comes, what are we doing to address this?\" she said, referring to the motivation behind the research.\n\nIn Ahmedabad, Bunker, along with researchers at the Indian Institute of Public Health Gandhinagar and the Ahmedabad Municipal Corporation, is constantly collecting relevant health data.\n\nIf they find that cool roofs effectively reduce indoor heat, they plan to paint the roofs of all the homes. Researchers hope their study leads to more use of solutions like cool roofs for poor, vulnerable populations around the world - and that policymakers will factor in such solutions when deciding how their countries and communities can adapt to increasing heat exposure.\n\nFor now, Vanzara Vas residents like Chunara and her neighbor, Shantaben Vanzara, said they will take any help they can get. Shantaben Vanzara said the heat has made her diabetes worse, but being part of the study has provided her family some respite. \"We don't get to sleep because of the heat,\" she said. \"After the roof got painted, we can sleep for a few hours a night at least.\"\n\nChunara said temperatures used to be predictable.\n\n\"Now we don't know when or what will happen,\" she said. \"The only thing that we know for sure is that the heat is getting worse every year.\"\n\n___\n\nThis report has been edited to correct the name of NRDC India, previously incorrectly given as the Natural Resources Defense Council.\n\nThe Associated Press' climate and environmental coverage receives financial support from multiple private foundations.

            "title": "U.K. Records Its Hottest May 1 Ever, Despite a Toilet Getting in the Way",
            "body": "Nazaneen Ghaffar is a London-based reporter on The Times's weather team.\n\nBritain bathed in an abundance of sunshine and above-average temperatures this week, leading to a record-breaking May 1 high on Thursday, beating the previous record set in 1990. However, a public toilet may have flushed hopes that one London park would be home to a record reading.\n\nThe unseasonably warm and sunny conditions were driven by a high-pressure system situated over the country, and temperatures climbed steadily throughout the week. On Monday, St. James's Park in central London, tucked between Buckingham Palace and Westminster Abbey, recorded its highest temperature so far this year, only to be outdone each subsequent day, culminating in another record-breaking day on Thursday.\n\nBut not so fast, record-keepers.\n\nObservations from a weather station in the park had to be disqualified, because of a \"contamination\" at the site. The culprit? Public toilets, barriers and generators that had been temporarily installed near the weather station in preparation for upcoming celebrations of the anniversary of V-E Day, cutting off crucial airflow needed for accurate readings.\n\n\"We have withdrawn observations from this weather station until the site has been returned to an acceptable standard,\" said a spokesperson for the Met Office, Britain's weather service.\n\nThe Met Office operates a national network of more than 200 automated weather stations, each of which monitors a range of meteorological variables including air temperature, atmospheric pressure, rainfall, wind speed and direction, humidity, cloud height and visibility.\n\nEnsuring consistency and accuracy across these measurements is essential both for real-time forecasting and for maintaining the nation's long-term weather and climate records. Weather stations must therefore meet strict criteria in line with international standards. It is not uncommon to have readings withdrawn or reviewed.\n\nAir temperatures are measured 1.25 meters above ground within a Stevenson screen, a ventilated white box designed to shield instruments from direct solar radiation. According to the Met Office, ideal sites for such equipment are level and free from nearby obstructions such as buildings or trees, which could influence readings.\n\nSo, although the station at St. James's Park recorded a high of 83 degrees Fahrenheit (28.1 Celsius) on Thursday, the reading was not considered valid for official records. However, another Met Office site at Kew Gardens, just a few miles away and apparently free of nearby toilets, registered the same maximum temperature early Thursday afternoon, officially marking Britain's warmest May 1 on record. Temperatures continued to rise later in the day, with a provisional reading of 84 degrees Fahrenheit (29.1 Celsius) in Surrey, just to the southwest of London.\n\nSt. James's Park is a long-established Met Office station dating back to around 1883 and is frequently among Britain's warmest locations. In July 2024, the station recorded a high of 89 degrees Fahrenheit (31.7 Celsius) during a heat wave that prompted widespread health alerts across England.\n\nTemperature records were also broken elsewhere this week. On Wednesday, Met Eireann, Ireland's national meteorological service, reported a provisional high of 79 degrees Fahrenheit (25.9 Celsius) in Athenry, County Galway, surpassing the country's previous April record of 78 (25.6), set in 1984. It was only the second time that temperatures in Ireland exceeded 77 degrees Fahrenheit during the month of April.\n\nThe current spell of warm weather is expected to end this weekend, as cooler air from the north moves in and temperatures return to seasonal averages.",

Those moves were advanced enough that the board chose a single head hunting firm for the search.\n\nMr Musk, who owns 13 per cent of Tesla, appeared to get the message, telling investors that \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla\".\n\nThe threat to remove Mr Musk now appears to have dissipated.\n\nTesla, Musk deny reports\n\nBoth Tesla and its CEO have hit back at the reports.\n\n\"It is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the WSJ would publish a deliberately false article and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors!\" wrote Mr Musk on X.\n\nTesla board chair Robyn Denholm also chimed in.\n\n\"Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,\" he stated.\n\n\"This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).\n\n\"The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.\"\n\n\"Tesla was given the opportunity to provide a statement before publication, which they did not do.\"",

            "body": "Miserly Australia tumbles down global generosity tableBen McKayAAPFri, 2 May 2025 1:36AM\n\nThe development sector has been dismayed by the coalition's pledge to cut foreign aid, which would see Australia tumble further down the ranks of global generosity.\n\nOn Thursday, the coalition announced it would axe $813 million in planned development assistance over the next four years.\n\nThe Pacific will be ring-fenced from any cuts.\n\nThe aid downgrade was widely expected in the sector, given Peter Dutton had been non-committal on questions about possible savings during the election campaign.\n\nAt a time of geopolitical tumult, Australian Council for International Development chief executive Matthew Maury said any cuts to aid would make Australia \"a less reliable global partner\".\n\n\"At a time when the world is facing huge global challenges, we urge the coalition to consider the bipartisan commitment to aid that has cemented Australia's standing in our region over decades,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, the coalition offered increased spending to the Pacific in one key area: infrastructure.\n\nShould Mr Dutton's party form government after Saturday's election, the coalition would lift infrastructure funding - through grants and loans - by $2 billion.\n\nACFID questioned the priority on infrastructure, saying \"most Pacific states cannot afford expensive loans\".\n\n\"The net result of the coalition's election announcements will impact millions of the world's most vulnerable facing rising hunger, conflict, disease and climate disasters,\" Mr Maury said.\n\nThe coalition made savage cuts to foreign aid the last time it won government from Labor, under Tony Abbott.\n\nSince taking office in 2022, Anthony Albanese's Labor government has increased foreign aid each year, but at a slower rate than Australian prosperity has grown.\n\nAs a share of gross national income (GNI), Australia spends 0.19 per cent on aid - ranking it 28th of 32 developed nations. On that measure, just four nations spend less: Czech Republic, Greece, Slovakia and Hungary.\n\nA decade earlier, Australia spent 0.31 per cent of GNI, and was ranked 13th.\n\nMr Maury said both major parties had an obligation to lift spending to support some of the world's poorest nations, calling on aid to all candidates to make aid at least one per cent of the budget, up from 0.68 per cent.\n\n\"The aid budget is already at a historic low,\" he said.\n\n\"With the challenges facing Australia and the whole world now is the worst time to be pulling back and making further cuts.\"\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

            "title": "The 141 executive orders Trump signed in his first 100 days",
            "body": "Trump 100 days: inside Trump's whirlwind start to his second presidency\n\nDonald Trump signed 141 executive orders since returning to the presidency in January, including enacting steep tariffs, ending birthright citizenship, curbing DEI and \"gender radicalism\" in the military, and pardoning January 6 rioters.\n\nThe US president promised in his inaugural speech that these orders would amount to a \"complete restoration of America\".\n\nHere's what to know about the major executive orders Trump signed in his first 100 days in office.\n\nThe orders: Trump signed three executive orders on 1 February placing tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada, to begin on 4 February.\n\nWhat the orders say: The Mexico order says that drug traffickers and the country's government \"have an intolerable alliance\" that endangers US security. The China order says the country's government allows criminal organizations to \"launder the revenues from the production, shipment, and sale of illicit synthetic opioids\". The Canada order says that Mexican cartels are operating in that country, claiming the amount of fentanyl imported could kill \"9.5 million Americans\".\n\nWhat it means: All three countries announced retaliatory actions. On 3 February, Trump agreed to postpone tariffs against Mexico and Canada for one month after they committed to increasing border enforcement. China has announced retaliatory tariffs on some American imports and an antitrust investigation into Google on 4 February after Trump's tariffs took effect.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 2 April implementing what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\".\n\nWhat Trump said: \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn. For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far,\" Trump said at a \"liberation day\" event in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nWhat it means: The tariffs range from 10% to 49% on all goods imported from abroad, and include a 25% tariff on all foreign automakers. World leaders responded to the news with a mix of confusion and concern.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 29 April on auto tariffs, watering down his sweeping plan. Trump curbed some duties on foreign cars and parts, granting a reprieve to the industry.\n\nWhat it means: Carmakers subject to a 25% tariff on imports will not be subject to other levies Trump has imposed, for example, on steel and aluminum. US automakers will also be allowed to apply for tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although that relief will be phased out over the next two years.\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump told reporters he wanted US automakers to \"enjoy this little transition short-term\".\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 2 April closing \"the de minimus loophole\" on China.\n\nWhat it means: The loophole allowed the China to export cheap goods to the US without paying taxes and import duties.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 6 March that will delay tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada covered by a free trade agreement between the three countries.\n\nWhat it means: Goods imported to the United States under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will be exempted from Trump's 25% tariffs for one month until 2 April.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"During this interim period between now and April 2, this makes it much more favorable for our American car manufacturers,\" Trump said.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 6 March to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve.\n\nWhat it means: The reserve \"will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings\", according to Trump's crypto czar, David Sacks. Creating the reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made during last year's election campaign.\n\nThe order: Trump announced 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum on 11 February, which will be enforced \"without exceptions or exemptions\". The action ends exemptions granted to certain countries and increases the duty rate on both metals to 25% (the duty on aluminum was previously 10%).\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the tariffs were not just about trade. \"It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum,\" he said.\n\nWhat to know: The changes are not due to come into effect until 12 March, raising the prospect the administration will broker deals with governments seeking reprieve.\n\nThe order: Trump ordered the US treasury and commerce department to create a sovereign wealth fund on 3 February. Such a fund, which requires congressional approval, would act as an investment fund for the country, operating outside the Federal Reserve and the treasury department.\n\nTrump offered few details about the fund, including where the cash would come from. His treasury secretary and the nominee for commerce secretary would spearhead efforts to create the fund. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent told reporters the government would \"stand this thing up within the next 12 months\".\n\nWhat Trump said: \"We have tremendous potential,\" Trump said. \"I think in a short period of time, we'd have one of the biggest funds.\"\n\nTrump also said that the fund could be used to facilitate the purchase of TikTok.\n\nWhat to know: More than 100 countries and 20 US states have sovereign wealth funds. Senior officials in the Biden administration had been quietly working on a sovereign wealth fund before the US election in November, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe order: On 23 January, Trump signed an executive order calling for a review of all Biden policies on AI, to remove policies that \"act as barriers to American AI innovation\". A second order called for a working group to start work on crypto regulations.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"We must develop AI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas\" to maintain the US's dominant position in AI technology, the order states.\n\nWhat it means: Former PayPal executive David Sacks has been tasked with leading a group to develop an AI action plan. Meanwhile another working group will start work on crypto regulations.\n\nThe order: Trump signed executive orders on 23 April targeting universities, with actions addressing foreign gifts, and directing the federal government to \"enforce laws on the books\" related to the disclosure of large donations, and college accreditation.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"We should be looking at those who have real merit to get in, and we have to look harder at those universities that aren't enforcing that,\" Trump's education secretary, Linda McMahon, said during the signing.\n\nWhat it means: The order comes as Trump's administration seeks to reshape higher-education institutions and continues to crack down on diversity and inclusion efforts.\n\nThe order: Trump signed two new executive orders on 28 April related to immigration: one targeting so-called \"sanctuary cities\", and another the administration says will \"strengthen and unleash\" law enforcement to pursue \"criminals\".\n\nWhat Trump said: The order targeting \"sanctuary cities\" calls for a list of state and local jurisdictions that \"obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws\", while the other directs support for officers who \"unjustly\" face legal costs from actions taken while performing official duties.\n\nThe order: Trump signed a handful of executive orders on 9 April punishing prominent law firms and attorneys that are connected to his rivals or that have taken on causes averse to his administration.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"There were some very bad things that happened with these law firms,\" he said in the Oval Office when signing an order against Susman Godfrey, the firm that obtained a $787.5m settlement from Fox for lies about the 2020 election.\n\nWhat it means: Trump has singled out numerous law firms, and others have struck deals with the president to avoid being targeted.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 19 February making independent regulatory agencies - such as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - accountable to the White House. Agencies will have to report new policy priorities to the executive branch for approval, which will also have a say over their budgets.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order ensures \"all federal agencies are accountable to the American people, as required by the constitution\", a White House fact sheet reads.\n\nWhat it means: The move comes as the White House has attempted to fundamentally reshape the US government. It makes agencies established by Congress accountable to the White House, a move that some experts say clashes with mainstream interpretations of the constitution.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 10 February directing the US justice department to halt prosecuting Americans accused of bribing foreign government officials to win business. It instructs the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to pause prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 until she issues revised enforcement guidance that promotes American competitiveness.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat to know: The White House says the law puts US firms at a disadvantage to foreign competitors because they cannot engage in practices that are \"common among international competitors, creating an uneven playing field\".\n\nThe order: Trump signed three executive orders on 27 January that would reshape the military: removing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; eliminating \"gender radicalism\" from the military; and reinstating soldiers who were expelled for refusing Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone,\" Trump said in Florida, according to CBS.\n\nWhat to know: Trump's order does not yet ban transgender soldiers from the military, but directs the Pentagon to create a policy for trans members of the military.\n\nThe order: Trump issued pardons for offenders and commutations related to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol on 20 January. He will direct the Department of Justice to dismiss cases currently in progress.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm going to be signing on the J6 hostages, pardons, to get them out,\" Trump said during his rally speech. \"We'll be signing pardons for a lot of people, a lot of people.\" Trump said he has pardoned about 1,500 defendants charged in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and issued six commutations.\n\nWhat it means: Trump made his pledge to issue pardons for those with convictions related to the January 6 Capitol attack a core part of his re-election campaign. On the campaign trail, Trump often featured the national anthem sung by prisoners in a Washington DC jail. There are more than 1,500 people federally charged with associated charges.\n\nWith Trump back in the White House, justice department investigations into January 6 crimes are expected to cease.\n\nThe order: Trump has signed an executive order on 20 February aimed at ending federal benefits for people in the country illegally.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order did not make it clear which benefits will be targeted, but said it will do away with all \"all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens\".\n\nWhat it means: This is part of broader efforts on immigration to fulfill Trump's promise to remove millions of people from the country.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 29 January to prepare a huge detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay that he said could be used to hold up to 30,000 immigrants deported from the US.\n\nWhat Trump said: Guant\u00e1namo could \"detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people\", Trump said during the signing of the Laken Riley Act, another of his administration's hardline immigration policies.\n\nWhat it means: The order is part of a broader effort to fulfill Trump's promise to remove millions of people from the country.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 27 January that would begin the process of creating a \"next-generation\" missile defense shield, which the administration is referring to as the American Iron Dome.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield,\" the order said.\n\nWhat to know: Creating a short-range missile defense system akin to Israel's Iron Dome would take years to build. The order calls for a plan from the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, within 60 days.\n\nThe order: On his first day in office on 20 January, Trump targeted automatic citizenship for US-born children of both undocumented people and some legal immigrants.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order specifies that it would limit birthright citizenship if a person's \"mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth\", or \"when that person's mother's presence in the United States at the time of said person's birth was lawful but temporary\".\n\nWhat it means: Birthright citizenship, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on US soil, is protected by the 14th amendment and any attempt to revoke it will bring immediate legal challenges. The order was temporarily blocked on 23 January, with the judge calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional\".\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 23 January suspending the country's refugee resettlement program. Refugees maybe only be admitted on a case-by-case basis so long as their entry is in the \"national interest\".\n\nWhat Trump said: The order cited \"record levels of migration\" to the US and said the country did not have the ability to \"absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees\".\n\nWhat it means: Advocates say the move put lives in danger and has left families devastated. Thousands of refugees are now stranded around the globe.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 2o January declaring an emergency at the southern US border, along with several other immigration-related policies.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,\" Trump said in his inauguration speech.\n\nWhat it means: The executive action paves the way to send US troops to the southern border and makes good on campaign promises to implement hardline immigration policies. There are limited details about how the administration plans to execute its sprawling set of immigration actions that were all but certain to face legal and logistical challenges.\n\nImmigrant communities across the country have been braced for Trump's promise to carry out the \"largest deportation program in American history\".\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 24 April making it easier to fire federal workers within their probationary period. These probationary employees already have fewer protections and were earlier targets of the administration.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The American people deserve a Federal workforce that is high-quality, efficient, dedicated to the public interest, and no larger than necessary,\" the order read.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 20 March that would begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nWhat it means: The order seemingly attempts to circumvent the need to obtain congressional approval to formally close a federal department.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"My administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department. We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good.\"\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 26 February expanding the power of Musk's so-called \"department of government efficiency\". It calls for a \"transformation\" in federal spending on contracts, grants and loans by requiring a centralized payment system - an initiative that would be monitored by Musk's team.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"This order commences a transformation in Federal spending on contracts, grants, and loans to ensure Government spending is transparent and Government employees are accountable to the American public,\" the order states.\n\nWhat it means: The order is part of a much broader effort by the White House to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\nThe order: Trump instructed the heads of every agency to undertake a review of all regulations on 19 February, working with members of Elon Musk's so-called \"department of government efficiency.\" It also targets a number of advisory committees and agencies for elimination.\n\nWhat Trump said: Any regulations that are deemed inconsistent with the administration's policies will be rescinded or modified, the order said.\n\nWhat it means: The action aims to bolster Musk's sweeping government-slashing effort, which is facing numerous court challenges over its lawfulness, and Trump's broader campaign to assert control over independent executive agencies.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 7 February attempting to eliminate \"anti-Christian bias\" in the US government. The president announced the formation of a taskforce, led by Bondi, to end all forms of \"anti-Christian targeting and discrimination\" in the government.\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump said Bondi would work to \"fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide\".\n\nWhat it means: The order is meant to reverse alleged targeting of \"peaceful Christians\" under Biden. Critics say it changes the traditional understanding of religious liberty, with Americans United for Separation of Church and State saying in a statement that Trump's taskforce would \"misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination and the subversion of our civil rights laws\".\n\nThe order: Trump ordered a review of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) on 27 January, the disaster response agency, and suggested there is \"political bias\" in the agency. Trump previously criticized the agency's response to Hurricane Helene.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, Fema has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most,\" the order stated.\n\nWhat it means: A review council - which includes the secretaries of defense and homeland security, Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem - will report to Trump within 180 days.\n\nThe order: Trump's executive order on 20 January reclassified thousands of federal employees as political hires, making it much easier for them to be fired.\n\nWhat Trump said: Aides to the president have long heralded mass government firings as part of an attack on the so-called \"administrative\" or \"deep\" state.\n\nWhat it means: Trump in effect reinstates \"Schedule F\", an executive order he signed in the last year of his first term, seeking to reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers. (Biden rescinded the order.)\n\nKey aides to Trump have called for mass government firings. Project 2025 made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump's second term. The rightwing playbook called for civil servants deemed politically unreliable to be fired and replaced by conservatives.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 6 February authorizing economic sanctions on the international criminal court (ICC), accusing the body of \"improperly targeting\" the United States and its allies, such as Israel.\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump has been a vocal critic of the ICC and said the court had \"abused its power\" in issuing warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. \"This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States government and our allies, including Israel,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat it means: The order grants Trump broad powers to impose asset freezes and travel bans against ICC staff and their family members if the US determines that they are involved in efforts to investigate or prosecute citizens of the US and certain allies.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 4 February stopping funding for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and withdrawing US from the UN human rights council.\n\nWhat Trump said: The president criticized the entire United Nations as \"not being well run\" and \"not doing the job\".\n\nWhat to know: In his first term, Trump cut Unrwa funding and withdrew from the UN's human rights council. The Biden administration restored Unrwa funding and rejoined the council.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It's not going to happen any more,\" Trump said at the signing. He accused the WHO of mishandling the Covid-19 pandemic and other international health crises.\n\nWhat it means: The US will leave the WHO in 12 months' time and stop all financial contributions to its work. The US is the biggest financial backer to the United Nations health agency.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 24 April aimed at boosting the deep-sea mining industry. It's part of a push to offset China's sweeping control of the critical minerals industry.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,\" a Trump official said.\n\nWhat it means: The order is Trump's latest attempt to boost US production of nickel, copper and other critical minerals used widely across the economy.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 8 April instructing the Department of Justice to \"stop the enforcement\" of state climate laws, which his administration has suggested are unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration's objective to unleash American energy,\" the executive order says. \"They should not stand.\"\n\nThe orders: Trump signed four executive orders on 8 April aimed at reviving the coal industry in the US. He used his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants scheduled for retirement to keep producing electricity, something the White House said is needed to meet increased energy demands from growth in datacenters, artificial intelligence and electric cars.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order \"slashes unnecessary regulations that targeted the beautiful, clean coal\".\n\nWhat it means: Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and its usage has long been in decline.\n\nThe order: Trump has ordered an expansion on 3 March in tree-cutting across 280m acres (113m hectares) of national forests and other public lands.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order calls for reversing \"heavy-handed federal policies\" and increasing \"domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security\".\n\nWhat it means: The order evades rules to protect endangered species and raises the prospect of chainsaws razing some of the most ecologically important trees in the US.\n\nThe order: Trump declared a national energy emergency on 20 January as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to \"unleash\" already booming US energy production that included also rolling back restrictions in drilling in Alaska and undoing a pause on gas exports.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order means \"you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem and we do have that kind of emergency\", Trump said. The order also says it is US policy for the country to \"fully avail itself of Alaska's vast lands and resources\".\n\nWhat it means: The declaration would allow his administration to fast-track permits for new fossil fuel infrastructure. It is likely that the order, part of a broader effort to roll back climate policy, will face legal challenges.\n\nThe order: Trump revoked a non-binding executive order on 20 January signed by Joe Biden aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The United States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat it means: Part of an effort to repeal Biden's environmental protections, Trump has also promised to roll back auto pollution standards finalized by Biden's administration last spring.\n\nThe order: Trump signed a wide-ranging executive action on 15 April aimed at lowering prescription drug prices.\n\nWhat it means: Trump directed his health department to work with Congress on revamping a law that allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, seeking to introduce a change the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied for.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 4 April to extend the TikTok ban deadline.\n\nWhat Trump said: The TikTok deal \"requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed\", Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nWhat it means: This was the second time the president delayed the ban or sale of TikTok. The move punts the deadline to 75 days from 4 April.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 28 April requiring commercial truck drivers to read and speak English.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"They should be able to read and understand traffic signs, communicate with traffic safety, border patrol, agricultural checkpoints, and cargo weight-limit station officers,\" the order said. \"This is common sense.\"\n\nWhat it means: Trump issued an order in March making English the official language of the United States.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 25 March to modernize the payment system at the US treasury.\n\nWhat it means: The order is meant to reduce potential fraud and abuse. It calls for accepting electronic payments whenever possible instead of physical checks.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order barring government and non-profit employees from a student loan forgiveness program if they engage in \"improper activities\".\n\nWhat it means: The order would disqualify workers at non-profit groups deemed to have engaged in certain activities from accessing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. That includes people whose work is tied to illegal immigration, foreign terrorist groups or other illegal activity. It's likely to face legal challenges.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 1 March making English the official language of the United States.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society,\" the order said.\n\nWhat it means: The US previously did not have an official language at the federal language. Hundreds of languages of are spoken across country, with English the most common. The order allows government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in languages other than English.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 25 February attempting to impose price transparency on healthcare costs. The rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"You're not allowed to even talk about it when you're going to a hospital or see a doctor. And this allows you to go out and talk about it,\" Trump said while signing the order. \"It's been unpopular in some circles because people make less money, but it's great for the patient.\"\n\nWhat it means: Trump previously issued a similar order in 2019, but hospitals and insurers strongly opposed the rule, with many failing to comply.\n\nThe order: Trump has signed an executive order on 18 February to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF). It directs the domestic policy council to make recommendations to \"aggressively\" reduce the costs for accessing IVF, according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"It is the policy of my administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable,\" a White House fact sheet reads.\n\nWhat to know: The order does not directly change any policy and does not, on its own, fulfill Trump's campaign pledge to make the government or insurance companies cover IVF.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 10 February ending the \"procurement and forced use of paper straws\". It calls for government agencies to stop buying paper straws and to create a strategy to eliminate them across the country.\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump, who sold branded plastic straws on the campaign trail last year, said paper straws don't work. \"These things don't work,\" he said, referring to paper straws. \"I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode.\"\n\nWhat to know: In 2024, the Biden administration announced that it would gradually phase out single-use plastics from federal operations by 2035.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 5 February banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sport. It directs federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, to interpret federal Title IX rules as the prohibition of trans girls and women from participating in any female sports categories.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"With this executive order, the war on women's sports is over.\"\n\nWhat it means: The order is the latest in a slew of Trump actions aimed at rolling back the rights of trans people. Trump also signed orders defining sex as \"only male or female\" and banning gender transitions for people under the age of 19.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 28 January that attempts to end gender transitions for people under 19.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" reads the order.\n\nWhat it means: The order directs that federally run insurance programs, including Tricare for military families and Medicaid, exclude coverage for such care. The order calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.\n\nThe order: On 23 January Trump ordered the release of thousands of classified documents on the assassinations of John F Kennedy, Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The federal government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events. Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,\" the order said.\n\nWhat it means: Trump made this promise during the election campaign and made a similar pledge in his first term, but ultimately heeded appeals from the CIA and FBI to withhold some documents.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"President Trump is bringing common sense to government and renewing the pillars of American Civilization,\" the executive order said in part.\n\nWhat it means: Trump ordered the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the \"Gulf of America\" and will rechristen Alaska's Mount Denali as Mount McKinley.\n\nIt will have no bearing on what names are used internationally.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 20 January to remove \"gender ideology guidance\" from federal government communication, policies and forms. The order makes it official policy that there are \"only two genders, male and female\".\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Agencies will cease pretending that men can be women and women can be men when enforcing laws that protect against sex discrimination,\" the order states.\n\nWhat it means: The order reverses a Biden-era executive action on the acceptance of gender identity.\n\nThe order: Trump ordered 78 Biden-era executive actions to be rescinded on 20 January, including at least a dozen measures supporting racial equity and combating discrimination against gay and transgender people.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'll revoke nearly 80 destructive and radical executive actions of the previous administration,\" Trump told a crowd in Washington after his inaugural speech. He also said he would end policy \"trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life\" and push for a \"color blind and merit-based\" society.\n\nWhat it means: The orders signal a reversal of Biden-era policy that prioritized implementing diversity measures across the federal government. Trump repealed orders signed by Biden advancing racial equity for underserved communities and the aforementioned order combating discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nThe order: Trump issued an executive action on 20 January withdrawing the US from the 2015 Paris agreement, along with a letter informing the United Nations of the decision.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I am immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord rip-off\" Trump said during a rally at the Capital One Arena. In his inaugural speech, Trump said he would use executive action to \"end the Green New Deal\".\n\nWhat it means: In 2017, Trump exited the Paris agreement. Upon taking office in 2021, Biden rejoined. Monday's order makes good on a Trump election promise to withdraw from the 2015 global treaty seeking to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\nExiting the Paris agreement is part of Trump's broader efforts to roll back climate protections and policy. Trump has described Biden's efforts to grow the US's clean energy sector as \"the green new scam\".\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn't have originally,\" Trump said at the White House, as he signed executive orders, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhat it means: Trump ordered his attorney general to not enforce the law requiring TikTok's sale. Trump says the pause allows for time to chart an \"appropriate course forward\" to protect national security and not abruptly shut down the popular app. In his first term, Trump favored a TikTok ban, but has since changed his position due to factors including his own popularity on the app.",

Katie Leung, an actress from the original films, also added her name to the document, per The Times of London.\n\n\"We the undersigned film and television professionals stand in solidarity with the trans, nonbinary and intersex communities who have been impacted by the Supreme Court ruling on April 16,\" the open letter says.\n\n\"We believe the ruling undermines the lived reality and threatens the safety of trans, non-binary and intersex people living in the UK,\" it said. \"Film and television are powerful tools for empathy and education, and we believe passionately in the ability of the screen to change hearts and minds. This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history.\"\n\nRedmayne, Essiedu, Leung and more than 2,000 other individuals added their names to the letter. Other celebrity signatories include \"The Last of Us\" star Bella Ramsey, \"The Brutalist\" actor and Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn, and \"Bridgerton\" actress Nicola Coughlan.\n\nMeanwhile, Rowling, who has been openly critical of the radical trans agenda for years, has been celebrating the Supreme Court ruling as a great victory.\n\n\"Think I might be having a cigar later,\" Rowling shared on X April 16 after the ruling was handed down.\n\n\"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK,\" the billionaire \"Harry Potter\" author wrote in a follow-up later. \"I'm so proud to know you.\"\n\nLeftist fans and trans activists were furious that Rowling would be involved in the upcoming TV adaptation, but HBO released a statement last fall confirming she would be involved despite the backlash.\n\n\"We are proud to once again tell the story of Harry Potter -- the heartwarming books that speak to power of friendship, resolve and acceptance,\" the statement said. \"J.K. Rowling has a right to express her personal views. We will remain focused on the development of the new series, which will only benefit from her involvement.\"",

            "body": "I knew David really, really well. I used to work at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.\n\nTruth Revolt, which was a precursor to The Daily Wire, began at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.\n\nI knew David for more than a decade before that. He was truly a formative person in the modern conservative movement, a person who spoke the truth no matter the cost.\n\nDavid started off as a radical communist. He wrote a book in 1996 titled \"Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey.\" In it, he talks about how his parents were communists and that he was a \"Red Diaper Baby.\"\n\nHe began his career as a far-Left writer for Ramparts magazine. He turned to the Right when his friend was allegedly killed by the Black Panthers. Then, basically all of his old friends disowned him and decided he was \"untouchable.\"\n\nDavid then turned into one of the most effective conservative activists of his generation. He used to call the David Horowitz Freedom Center a \"battle tank\" rather than a think tank. Pretty much everybody who's anybody in modern conservatism had some initial connection with David Horowitz. I met Charlie Kirk, for example, at a David Horowitz Freedom Center event back when Charlie was maybe 18- or 19- years old and was first getting started with TPUSA.\n\nAnd that remains true for a huge number of people who got their start in the conservative movement in the 1990s and 2000s. His books are worth reading. He was really an amazing writer, a terrific speaker, and a strong voice.\n\nHorowitz: Will you condemn Hamas here and now?\n\nRadical Student: I'm sorry, what?\n\nHorowitz: Will you condemn Hamas? Will you condemn Hamas as a terrorist and genocidal organization?\n\nRadical Student: Are you asking me to put myself on a cross?\n\nHorowitz: So you won't. I actually have had this experience many times. You didn't read the pamphlet because the pamphlet is chapter and verse. The main connection is that the MSA is part of the Muslim Brotherhood network, as revealed in the document.\n\nRadical Student: I don't think you understood what I meant by that. I meant if I say something, I'm sure that I will be arrested for reasons of Homeland Security. So if you could please just answer my question.\n\nHorowitz: If you condemn Hamas, Homeland Security will arrest you?\n\nRadical Student: If I support Hamas -- because your question forces me to condemn Hamas -- if I support Hamas, I look really bad.\n\nHorowitz: Well, if you don't condemn Hamas, obviously you support it. Case closed. I've had this experience at UC Santa Barbara, where there were 50 members of the Muslim Students Association sitting right in the rows there. And throughout my hour talk, I kept asking them, \"Will you condemn Hezbollah and Hamas?\" And none of them would. And then when the question period came, the president of the Muslim Students Association was the first person to ask questions. I said, \"You know, before you start, will you condemn Hezbollah?\" And he said, \"Well, that question is too complicated for a yes or no answer.\" So I said, \"Okay, I'll put it to you this way. I'm a Jew. The head of Hezbollah has said that he hopes that we will gather in Israel so he doesn't have to hunt us down globally -- for it or against it?\n\nRadical Student: For it.\n\nHorowitz: Thank you. Thank you for coming and showing everybody what's here.\n\nDavid was extremely clear in his approach to the world. He understood the morality of many of our foreign adversaries. He was an advocate for Americanism and American strength and security. And he will very much be missed.",

            "body": "A sprawling estate on the shores of Lake Thonotosassa, just outside Tampa, Florida, is set to hit market for $23.6 million -- complete with a 900-square-foot replica of the Oval Office.\n\nBuilt in 2012 by the late healthcare entrepreneur Tom Simpson and his wife, June, the custom-designed property spans 22 acres and reflects the couple's distinct passions, from American history to Major League Baseball.\n\nThe oval-shaped room, which features a copy of the Resolute Desk and was decorated annually with official White House ornaments, was a particular source of joy for Tom, June Simpson told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported this listing.\n\n\"It was just something he wanted,\" she told the Journal. \"It made him happy.\"\n\nThe desk was previously used in the film \"National Treasure,\" she added.\n\nThe Simpsons, who sold their company Health Advocates to AmerisourceBergen for $83 million in 2006, acquired the Thonotosassa land in stages beginning around 2008.\n\nJune Simpson said the location appealed to them in part because of her interest in gardening, though much of the interior was tailored to Tom's extensive memorabilia collections.\n\nAmong the standout spaces is a baseball-themed room outfitted with a custom rug designed like a diamond, vintage Yankee Stadium seats and display cases for Tom's Atlanta Braves memorabilia.\n\nThe room, which cost about $150,000 to build, was a frequent gathering spot for events, hosting 30 to 40 people at a time.\n\nElsewhere in the home, a hallway known as the \"Walk of Fame\" showcases signed guitars used by performers like The Beach Boys and Aerosmith, along with floor plaques honoring celebrities the couple met, including Tom Hanks, Elton John, Lady Gaga and Cher.\n\nThe estate also includes an indoor lagoon with a waterfall and has hosted a variety of events, including one for the US Navy SEALs.\n\nDuring the occasion, June recalled how they pretended to kidnap her son and used dogs and simulated gunfire to stage a rescue.\n\n\"It was unbelievable,\" she said.\n\nAfter Tom passed away in 2024 at age 79 following a battle with Parkinson's disease, June decided to sell the home.\n\n\"Walking through this house, as beautiful as it is, it's got so many wonderful memories, but I just can't do it,\" she said. \"I just can't.\"\n\nThe property, which features six bedroom suites and 12 bathrooms, is listed by Karen L. Hegemeier and Paul DeSantis of Premier Sotheby's International Realty.\n\nIt can be purchased in its entirety or in two separate parcels: $18.9 million for the main residence on 14 acres and $4.7 million for the remaining 8 acres, which include a barn and greenhouse.\n\nIf sold at asking price, the home could surpass Tampa's current record residential sale -- Derek Jeter's $22.5 million transaction in 2021.\n\nHegemeier noted that luxury deals in the region have picked up recently as some affluent buyers seek a hedge against market volatility.\n\nWealthy buyers are paying all cash for real estate amid the stock market's unpredictability, Hegemeier said.",

            "body": "The \"Prepper Bar,\" a perforated precious metal bar, offers a novel solution for divisibility and portability, addressing the challenge of using metals for smaller transactions. This innovation underscores the growing trend of seeking tangible assets for financial security in uncertain times.\n\nIndividuals might find it prudent to reassess their banking practices in light of several converging factors: the diminishing value of savings due to inflation, the looming threat of bank failures reminiscent of past crises and the intrinsic vulnerabilities of the fractional reserve banking system. This is not just about moving money; it's about safeguarding wealth in an era of unprecedented economic challenges.\n\nThe first concern is the insidious effect of inflation on the purchasing power of money. Consider this: if you had left $1 million in a bank account since 1913, its value would have dwindled to a mere $40,000 by 2024. This staggering loss of purchasing power is a direct result of inflation, a phenomenon that has consistently outpaced the interest rates offered by traditional savings accounts.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Historically, periods of high inflation have often coincided with economic turmoil, such as the stagflation of the 1970s. However, the current economic climate, marked by unprecedented monetary stimulus and supply chain disruptions, has exacerbated the situation. The Federal Reserve's recent pivot towards higher interest rates may offer some respite, but the damage to savings has already been done.\n\nThe second, more immediate fear is the possibility of another wave of bank closures. The 2023 banking crisis, which saw the collapse of several regional banks, serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities within the financial system. Even if your bank remains open, the ability to access your funds is not guaranteed.\n\nWhile banks are legally obligated to return depositors' funds, the practicalities of doing so can be fraught with obstacles. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, imposed stricter regulations on banks, but it also introduced measures that could restrict access to funds during a crisis.\n\nFinancial advisors also highlight the mechanics of fractional reserve banking, a system where banks are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits in reserve. This means that the money you deposit is often lent out to other customers, sometimes up to nine or ten times over. While this practice fuels economic growth, it also means that in the event of a bank run, the bank may not have sufficient liquidity to meet withdrawal demands.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical scenario. The 2008 financial crisis saw a similar dynamic play out, with banks teetering on the brink of insolvency as panicked depositors rushed to withdraw their funds. The subsequent bailouts by the government highlighted the interconnectedness of the financial system and the potential for systemic risk.\n\nIn light of these risks, many think a strategic shift in how individuals manage their finances is in order. The first step is to withdraw excess funds from traditional bank accounts. But where should this money go? The answer lies in alternative investments, particularly precious metals like gold and silver.\n\nPrecious metals have historical resillience, and have \"stood the test of time back to the Bible times as being the best store of wealth to weather out a storm in the economy.\" This is not just anecdotal evidence. Central banks around the world have been accumulating gold at an unprecedented rate, a clear indication of their confidence in its value.\n\nMoreover, the tax advantages of holding gold and silver in an IRA (Investment Retirement Account), a strategy that aligns with the principle of minimizing tax liabilities. This approach is not just about preserving wealth; it's about optimizing it in a way that aligns with long-term financial goals.\n\nIn addition to traditional bullion and coins, a new product that has caused a stir in the precious metals industry: the Prepper Bar.\n\nThis innovative bar, available in both silver and gold, is perforated to allow for easy breaking into smaller, tradeable pieces. This feature addresses a common challenge with precious metals: their lack of divisibility. The Prepper Bar offers a practical solution for those who need to use their wealth in smaller, more manageable increments.\n\nIn conclusion, the consensus is clear: the time to act is now. The financial landscape is fraught with risks, from the devaluation of the dollar to the potential for bank closures.\n\nBy diversifying into precious metals and exploring alternative investment vehicles like the Genesis Gold IRA, individuals can protect their wealth and ensure their financial security in an uncertain world.",

This is all devastating to wildlife, on land or sea.\n\nIncineration plants are used to dispose of much of this modern clothing trash, but they come with a bad track record. Furthermore, the petrochemical industry saw disinvestment from fossil fuel on the horizon decades ago, so its promoters headed towards every other business that could use it, resulting in a huge move towards plastic packaging and manmade textiles, even though it would lead to industrial-scale pollution.\n\nIt would be useful for articles to progress from shoppers' difficulties in making eco-friendly choices to compare clothing manufactured from natural materials. These do incur an environmental cost, but should be easier to dispose of, except that the fibre must be unblended, stitching must be cotton or linen, and the final garment unadorned with manmade features such as fasteners, care labels, and embroidered logos.\n\nThe social cost of our clothing must also be reckoned with. Sweatshops and child labour are involved in the processing of cotton. The supply chain is global and difficult to trace. There are healthier ways to stock our wardrobes and it would be a positive contribution if the Guardian could write about more that aren't cripplingly expensive.\n\nJane Eades\n\nTruro, Cornwall\n\nI started mailing plastic packaging to CEOs and MPs in 2007 to highlight frustration at having plastic imposed on consumers and then paying in our council tax to landfill or incinerate it, both of which produce toxic residue. The \"polluter pays\" policy doesn't seem to apply to retailers, who blame manufacturers while extolling the virtues of plastic for keeping food undamaged as it gathers food miles.\n\nI've bought most of my clothing secondhand all my life, but charity shop textiles have gone downhill. Even the new stuff is unwearable. I am reminded of Brentford Nylons in th 1970s - sweaty bedsheets, gaudy patterns and static shocks. I now buy better-quality, natural textiles that last, and I mend what I can for as long as I can. In times past, two sets of clothes sufficed and were left in your will. That does sound extreme, but maybe we should start by simply consuming less while finding new ways to repurpose material.\n\nHelen McDowall\n\nBampton, Devon\n\nWhile I take the point that shops shouldn't sell this stuff, I can't help think that it is also down to consumers to take responsibility. Shops sell what people want to buy. For all those sending clothes back in outrage, it would be interesting to know how many other synthetic items they've purchased since the offending item. There are many natural material choices available that can be easily recycled if you check the label before purchasing.\n\nBuy a cotton sheet, not polycotton. Denim without elastic is available if you go for non-stretch versions. Maybe if people favoured natural fabrics with their purchasing power, and bought less in the first place, it would be less of a problem.\n\nEllie Clarke\n\nLondon",

            "title": "Prosecutors in Thailand say they won't pursue royal defamation case against U.S. scholar",
            "body": "BANGKOK -- State prosecutors in Thailand announced Thursday that they don't intend to press charges against an American academic arrested for royal defamation, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe arrest last month of Paul Chambers, a political science lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, had drawn concern from the academic community, especially from Asian studies scholars around the world, as well as the U.S. government\n\nThe decision not to prosecute the 58-year-old Oklahoma native doesn't immediately clear him of the charge of insulting the monarchy- also known as \"l\u00e8se majest\u00e9\" - or a related charge of violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activities.\n\nThe announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.\n\nChambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, was arrested in early April on a complaint made by the northern regional office of the army's Internal Security Operations Command.\n\nHe has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.\n\nThe army's Internal Security Operations Command told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included Chambers as a participant.\n\nChambers' supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, wasn't written by him.\n\nHe had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.\n\nChambers' visa was revoked at the time of his arrest on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. It wasn't immediately clear whether the revocation will stand.\n\n\"This case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand,\" a U.S. State Department statement said after Chambers' arrest. \"We continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\"\n\nThailand's l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law calls for three to 15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it's among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.\n\nThe monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.\n\nHowever, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.\n\nThat led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people - many of them student activists - have been charged with violating the law.",

Lou Correa and George Whitesides.\n\nOther Democrats in the number include Reps. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., Hillary Scholten, D-Mich., and Frank Mrvan, D-Ind.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS REVEALS TIMETABLE FOR MAKING MAJOR POLITICAL DECISION IN DEEP BLUE STATE\n\nIt was a stunning repudiation of their own former party leader's policies targeting one of Democrats' largest strongholds.\n\nRepublican leaders, meanwhile, cheered the resolution's passage.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said of the California waiver, \"This radical measure bans the sale of gas-powered vehicles, forcing electric vehicles on the American people and taking away consumer choice.\"\n\n\"Americans should choose which car best suits their needs and the needs of their family, not the government,\" Scalise told Fox News Digital.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said, \"There is no reason the radical climate policies of California should regulate the entire American population and rob every American of consumer choice.\"\n\n\"House Republicans are righting yet another wrong done by the Biden administration and returning basic freedom to choose whatever car you want to the American people,\" Emmer told Fox News Digital.\n\nHHS DOWNSIZING BEGINS AMID RFK JR. 'MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN' PUSH: 'WIN-WIN FOR TAXPAYERS'\n\nRep. John Joyce, R-Pa., vice chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, introduced a resolution of disapproval last month targeting a Biden administration-era waiver granted to California that would help the state realize its goal of a full ban on the sale of new gas cars by 2035.\n\nA resolution of disapproval, under the Congressional Review Act, allows lawmakers a mechanism to oppose unilateral rules made by federal agencies.\n\nBiden's EPA approved a waiver for California in December 2024, just over a month before he left office, that would make it possible for the state to phase out new gas-powered car sales by 2035.\n\nThe waiver was granted despite concerns raised by major automakers earlier that year about the feasibility of California's goals - but state officials pushing the plan have insisted it was critical to take on climate change.\n\nAt the time, the Biden administration argued the waiver amounted to an order rather than a regulatory rule, meaning it would not be subject to congressional review.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, it has been the subject of a standoff between the Trump administration and the federal bureaucracy since then.\n\nThe Trump administration asked Congress to review the waiver in late February of this year - paving the way for a potential repeal under the GOP-controlled House and Senate.\n\nHowever, the Government Accountability Office said in March that California's waiver is not subject to the Congressional Review Act.",

            "title": "When Trump's Immigration Crackdown Came to Yemi Mobolade's City",
            "body": "Shattered glass and spilled beer coated the floors of the nightclub. More than 100 people had been taken into custody by federal immigration agents, and Colorado Springs's mayor, Yemi Mobolade, had a decision to make.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said their operation in the Sunday morning darkness cleared out a club that was rife with drugs, guns and prostitution. Liberal voters who helped elect Mr. Mobolade, a Nigerian-born pastor and political independent, to lead their historically conservative city were disturbed by the mass arrest of so many immigrants.\n\nMr. Mobolade made his choice.\n\n\"This immigrant mayor says, if you're here illegally and you're committing a crime, there should be consequences,\" he said in an interview. \"You should be deported.\"\n\nThe raid, led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, came the week after a large-scale operation in Florida that led to the arrests of more than 1,100 people. But this one was conducted in Democratic Colorado, in an increasingly purple city, Colorado's second largest. The aftermath of the raid reflects the deep divisions over President Trump's mass deportation efforts.\n\nMr. Mobolade and other mayors in Colorado, New York and Massachusetts have faced frustration and criticism from voters over their response to record-breaking migrant arrivals under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Now they face a backlash from the left, as the Trump administration steps up its immigration crackdown and presses local officials to cooperate.\n\nSome of Mr. Mobolade's left-leaning voters felt betrayed by the raid. The arrests and a lack of information about what had become of the detainees unnerved many immigrants. What's more, the city of Colorado Springs had participated by sending about 50 police officers to assist federal agents.\n\nOn Tuesday, about 30 people protested outside the local sheriff's office, waving banners that condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shouting, \"Immigrants are welcome here!\"\n\n\"These raids are not about public safety,\" said Brandon Rincon, an organizer with the Colorado Springs Peoples Coalition. \"These are terror attacks on our community.\"\n\nBut Mr. Mobolade, who first came to the United States on a student visa, said he saw a clear difference between immigrants who came to the United States to work and the people who were scooped up and put on buses Sunday.\n\n\"I know there's a bigger immigration story going on, but this is about criminal behavior,\" he said.\n\nMr. Mobolade's election as mayor in 2023 captured the changing character of Colorado Springs, a city of 490,000 at the base of Pikes Peak, where large military bases and the headquarters of the Christian conservative organization Focus on the Family helped forge a culture on the political right.\n\nAn influx of liberal and moderate voters who have been priced out of Denver and Boulder has nudged the city toward the center, while the rest of Colorado has moved sharply left. Mr. Mobolade, a political newcomer, beat an establishment Republican to become the first Black mayor of a city whose population is roughly two-thirds white, and its first non-Republican mayor in more than 40 years.\n\nHis winning message: unity.\n\nStill, the 46-year-old mayor has found it hard to escape the country's culture wars, as he tried to help Colorado Springs recover from a 2022 mass shooting at an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub, and to focus on bread-and-butter issues such as reducing homelessness and keeping the U.S. Space Command headquarters in town.\n\nMr. Trump's political comeback has had an impact. Mr. Mobolade said he had stopped describing the city as \"inclusive\" because of the battles over diversity, equity and inclusion. In the interview in his sixth-floor office, between meetings on public safety and summertime parks events, he wondered whether it was now polarizing even to call his city \"welcoming.\"\n\n\"We're forced to deal with the national chaos and conversation around identity politics,\" he said.\n\nSome neighbors living near the raided nightclub praised law enforcement for helping to clean up what they called a rough corner of town. Several of them called the D.E.A.'s Denver field office to leave grateful voice mail messages, officials said. \"Does my heart good to know somebody's looking after my safety,\" one man is heard to say.\n\nJonathan Pullen, the special agent in charge of the D.E.A.'s Rocky Mountain Field Division, described the nightclub, known as Warike, as a \"den of iniquity.\" It opened at 2 a.m. on weekends and drew a largely Latino clientele who learned of the club through Spanish-language posts on social media and word of mouth.\n\n\"Everything about it is illegal,\" Mr. Pullen said in an interview.\n\nAt the time of the raid, the club was operating in a mostly vacant strip mall, near a Mexican restaurant and a Hispanic market. The club had bounced from location to location, law enforcement officers said. A man who appeared to be the club's landlord declined on Thursday to comment, and the club's management could not be reached.\n\nThe D.E.A. began investigating the club earlier this year, and determined through undercover operations and surveillance that dealers inside were selling drugs. The raid found meth and a pink-dyed recreational drug known as tusi that often contains a mix of ketamine and other drugs, officials said. In mid-April, agents saw two patrons pointing guns out of their car windows and shooting into the air as they drove around outside the club, Mr. Pullen said.\n\nEarly on Sunday, agents from the D.E.A. and 10 other federal agencies surrounded the building and issued a bilingual order for the roughly 200 people inside to come out with their hands up. Photos and video posted online by the D.E.A. show patrons in sheer shirts, high-heel boots, and in one case a hot-pink suit, surrendering to agents in helmets and tactical vests.\n\nFederal officials said they had detained 114 people from countries including Mexico, Cuba, El Salvador and Venezuela. An ICE spokesman did not respond to a message asking how many of the detainees remained in custody on Thursday, or whether they would face deportation proceedings.\n\nMr. Pullen said the raid was primarily part of a drug investigation, not an immigration raid, and that the investigation was continuing. But he said federal agents had a duty to apprehend undocumented immigrants when they encountered them during an investigation.\n\n\"We didn't ask these illegal immigrants to come to this club,\" he said. \"They want to be involved where criminality is involved? Then this is the result.\"\n\nFederal agents detained 17 active-duty members of the U.S. military inside the club. Some of them had been working there as armed security, officials said. The service members were handed over to the Army's criminal investigations division.\n\nOn Thursday, the F.B.I. announced what appear to be the first criminal charges stemming from the raid, with the arrest of a soldier based at Fort Carson on charges of cocaine distribution.\n\nThe Colorado Springs police said two people caught up in the raid were arrested on outstanding warrants.\n\nSome people in Colorado Springs questioned why more than 100 immigrants were detained during the raid while most other patrons had been allowed to go home.\n\n\"They just went to a party,\" said Sarah Myers, the daughter of an undocumented Mexican father, who joined the protest criticizing the raid. \"Now their family doesn't know where they are.\"\n\nThe Colorado Springs officers who assisted in the raid largely stayed on the edges to secure the area, according to Adrian Vasquez, the city's police chief. He said city officers were not involved in detaining anyone on immigration charges.\n\nLast year, Colorado Springs passed a resolution declaring that it is not a sanctuary city. Even so, the police are bound by state laws that limit how law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.\n\nAbout 20 percent of Colorado Springs residents are Latino, and the city celebrates local Hispanic figures with a Hispanic Heritage Month. Still, Nayda Benitez, whose mother is undocumented and who is protected by an Obama-era rule that shields immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, said her family sometimes felt uncomfortable speaking Spanish in the city. She worried that the raid would drive even more immigrants into the shadows.\n\n\"They don't want to be targeted,\" said Ms. Benitez, the organizing director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition.\n\nOutside the nightclub site, which has been boarded up, a food truck that sells barbecued chicken has lost much of its Spanish-speaking clientele since the raid. As he dished out thighs and drumsticks from the truck this week, Luis Perez, 21, said his Mexican American family had little sympathy for anyone who was arrested that night, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nHe said he and his family had no plans to leave.\n\n\"We feel that Colorado is the safest state,\" he said.",

            "title": "Sex assault reports in the U.S. military fell last year, fueled by a big drop in the Army",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- The number of sexual assaults reported across the U.S. military dipped by nearly 4% last year, fueled by a significant drop in the Army, according to a new Pentagon report. It was the second year in a row with a decrease, reversing a troubling trend that has plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade.\n\nSenior defense officials said that while the decline is a good sign, the number of reported assaults is still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime.\n\nAccording to the report, there were 8,195 reported sexual assaults in 2024 involving members of the military, compared with 8,515 in 2023. In 2022, there were 8,942 reported sexual assaults, a spike that triggered widespread alarm and led to new programs and an infusion of funding to try to combat the problem.\n\nThe overall decrease was due to a 13% drop in reported sexual assaults across the Army, which is the largest military service.\n\nAll the other services saw increases. The Navy had the largest jump of 4.3%, while the Air Force had a 2.2% increase and the Marine Corps rose by less than 1%.\n\nOf the 8,195 total, there were 512 service members who reported an assault that happened before they entered the military. The Pentagon encourages reporting so that victims can get any support they need. In addition, 641 were civilians who said they were assaulted by a member of the military.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Nate Galbreath, director of the Pentagon's sexual assault prevention and response office, said it's still not clear how the Trump administration's personnel and budget cuts will affect these programs. He said officials are asking for details on the number of assault prevention staff who have been laid off or who took any of the early retirement offers.\n\nAndra Tharp, director of the command climate office, added that \"when the hiring freeze went into effect, there were about 300 prevention workforce positions posted on USA jobs that are essentially on hold.\" But, she said, some departments have been able to get exemptions.\n\nGalbreath said the department also is now able to link sexual assaults to military readiness. He said a survey showed that service members who had experienced assault were more likely to leave the military, be demoted, miss a promotion or have some other type of negative action put in their files than those who hadn't been been victimized.\n\nHe said the survey followed troops who said in 2016 that they had experienced a sexual assault, and a group of others who did not.\n\nAs a result, he said the Defense Department is working to develop a recovery program to teach healthy coping skills and other assistance for victims. The department also has a Safe Helpline where troops can seek help.\n\nWhile reported assaults decreased, the number of sexual harassment complaints went from 2,980 in 2023 to 3,014 last year. Most were filed by female service members, and the vast majority of those accused were male.\n\nThe number of cases in which misconduct was substantiated increased a bit last year over the 2023 total. The number of discharges and administrative actions against alleged perpetrators continued to increase, and court-martial charges declined - both trends going back several years.\n\nOfficials noted that nearly three-quarters of the court-martial cases ended in convictions, a slight increase over the previous year.\n\nSexual assault reports in the military have gone up for much of the past decade, except for a tiny decrease in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Officials say they are optimistic about the recent decreases but say much more work needs to be done.\n\nAs in previous years, most sexual assault reports are filed by those between ages 18 and 24 and involve lower-ranking service members.\n\nWhile it is difficult to point to any one reason for the two-year decline, the Defense Department has been making a series of changes over the past year that officials say may be contributing.\n\nThe services were using more than $1 billion to improve programs and hire up to 2,500 personnel as part of a new \"prevention workforce\" and place them at military installations worldwide.\n\nSo far, about 1,400 have been hired, but that process has stalled due to the Trump administration's budget and personnel cuts across the federal government. Defense officials said they are working to spread the existing workers around to lessen the gaps until more can be hired.\n\nThe latest report also reflects the first full year since new prosecution procedures have been in place, putting independent lawyers in charge of those decisions and sidelining commanders after years of pressure from Congress.\n\nOfficials said it is too soon to tell what effect those changes are having on prosecutions.\n\nThe Pentagon releases a report every year on the number of sexual assaults reported by or about troops. But because sexual assault is a highly underreported crime, the department also does a confidential survey every two years to get a clearer picture of the problem. That online survey came out last year, so it was not done this year.\n\nLast year's survey said more than 29,000 active-duty service members said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the previous year, compared with nearly 36,000 in the 2021 survey, according to several defense officials. The decrease was the first in eight years.\n\nBut officials said the survey also indicates that a large number of service members never file a report.\n\nDefense officials have long argued that an increase in reported assaults is a positive trend because so many people are reluctant to report them, both in the military and in society as a whole. Greater reporting, they say, shows there is more confidence in the reporting system and greater comfort with the support for victims.",

            "body": "Throughout the month of April, Fox News primetime attracted five(!) times as many total viewers as far-left CNN.\n\nAs I have made clear since time began, I am no Fox News fan. So, I am not here championing Fox News. Cable news as a format is toxic to the human condition. Not watching the news, especially cable news, is like ceasing to hit yourself over the head with a hammer.\n\nStill ... LOL.\n\nThroughout all of April, the full month, CNN -- a left-wing propaganda outlet that traffics in conspiracy theories and spreads violence -- was only able to attract an average of 519,000 prime-time viewers. Fox News, however, attracted an average of 2.592 million prime-time viewers. Do that math and then throw your head back and laugh.\n\nIn the crucial 25-54 age demographic, CNN attracted a measly 99,000 viewers, while Fox News earned nearly three times as many: 296,000.\n\nThis is the age demo that sets advertising rates. In the age 25-54 demo category MSNBC attracted only 105,000 viewers.\n\nIn May, Fox News attracted an average of 264,000 primetime viewers in that key demographic. The last time their 25-54 ratings were so low for a single month was August of 2001, or just before the September 11th attacks. Although Fox News's individual shows continue to win out over their competitors, May produced decade-low numbers for their primetime and morning hosts, particularly in the 25-54 demographic used by advertisers. And that's why those figures matter so much: Fox News's audience is still relatively huge, but it's taking in smaller numbers of the only viewers ad buyers pay attention to.\n\nInverse in June of 2015: \"On Average, Fox News Viewers Are 68. How Long Before Their Average Is Dead?\"\n\nNew York Magazine in 2013: \"Only Old People Watch Fox News\"\n\nWhile the 25 to 54 group, a.k.a. the \"demos\" in TV-speak, is the most sought-after, Fox's bottom line has not been affected. Yet. A sort-of-revitalized CNN is gaining a bit in the ratings, while the \"downward trend in younger viewers seems to be accelerating at Fox News[.]\"\n\nFrank Rich in 2014:\n\nFox News is losing younger viewers at an even faster rate than its competitors. With a median viewer age now at 68 according to Nielsen data through mid-January (compared with 60 for MSNBC and CNN, and 62 to 64 for the broadcast networks), Fox is in essence a retirement community ... If it is actuarially possible, its median viewer age will keep creeping upward. (It rose by two years over the course of 2013.)\n\nRemember that? Remember how the fake media told us that the era of Fox News dominating the cable news ratings would come to an end as soon as their old-ass viewers died off? Are these liars ever right about anything? Remember, these are the same people who assure us we need to become communists to stop Global Warming.\n\nHere the raw numbers for the month of April -- suck on it, CNN...\n\n\"Compared to March, CNN was down -12% in total viewers and -18% in the demo during primetime,\" reported AdWeek. \"Across total day, it dropped -5% in total viewers and -13% in the demo.\" [sic]\n\n\"Relative to April 2024, CNN was down -17% in total viewers and -12% in the demo. In total day, CNN saw respective declines of -19% and -23% in those categories.\" [sic]\n\nFox News saw even bigger dips compared to March, but compared to last year, \"the network was up by +31% in total viewers and +35% in the demo. In total day, it was up a respective +28% and +29% in those categories.\" [sic]\n\nBut-but-but you told me ten years ago Fox News viewers would all be dead. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *deep breath* HAHAHAHAHAHA...",

            "title": "Opinion | The F Word Won't Save Democrats",
            "body": "You're reading the Frank Bruni newsletter, for Times subscribers only. Reflections on the mess (and magic) of politics and life. Get it with a Times subscription.\n\nOne of the few occasions recently when I felt confidence in Democrats' ability to counter Donald Trump was Senator Elissa Slotkin's response to his address to a joint session of Congress in early March. After Trump bloviated for 100 minutes, Slotkin talked plainly for about 10.\n\nShe kept it simple. The president, she said, was failing on three crucial fronts -- the economy, national security and democracy. She presented the evidence. Suggested alternatives. Said good night.\n\nThat was all. And that was enough -- a rejection of hooey and histrionics that underscored the Trump administration's surfeit of both.\n\nBut in the DNA of every Democrat lurks the temptation to overthink and overcomplicate things, and Slotkin last week succumbed to it.\n\nIn an interview with Politico that previewed what she called her \"war plan\" for her party, she proclaimed that Democrats must no longer be \"weak and woke.\" I take her point. I question her alliteration. Contrived slogans don't say: I'm getting strong and real. They say: I've got consultants and the time for semantic noodling.\n\nSlotkin also confused plain-spokenness and profanity, dropping the F bomb at the start of an exhortation that her party \"retake the flag.\" That wasn't the end of her expletives. I suppose she was going for earthiness, but that's hardly a proxy for worthiness. It felt gimmicky -- the exact opposite of her March remarks.\n\nThose remarks were pitched directly to voters. But now she's taking aim at fellow Democrats. In her view, the Fighting Oligarchy tour starring Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez channels the right rage with the wrong vocabulary: How many Americans know an oligarch from a plutocrat from a kleptocrat from some other polysyllabic jerk?\n\n\"Well, jeez,\" Sanders retorted during an appearance days later on the NBC News show \"Meet the Press.\" \"We had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. We had 30,000 people in Folsom, Calif., which is kind of a rural area. I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are.\"\n\nThey're certainly smarter than Democratic politicians, who aren't slouching towards Bethlehem but squabbling towards oblivion.\n\nIt makes no sense for Slotkin to be sniping at anyone in her party who is mobilizing voters as effectively as Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are. It serves no purpose for Sanders to respond snottily to Slotkin. We're sprinting towards autocracy; egos and acrimony have no place in the opposition to that. The F word, the O word -- my word! What pointless distractions.\n\nEqually foolish are the plans by the political activist David Hogg, who is the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, to funnel millions to Democratic candidates who wage primary challenges in 2026 against party incumbents. That makes the story about Democrat versus Democrat. It must be solely and solidly about Democrats versus Trump.\n\nWhy are they struggling so mightily with the messaging for that battle? I understand their paralysis about what to do in the face of Trump's assaults on economic logic, important alliances, civil liberties, congressional oversight, the separation of powers: They hold few levers beyond lawsuits.\n\nBut what to say isn't that hard. Slotkin herself demonstrated as much in March.\n\nDirect voters, in unadorned language, to how Trump is governing. And ask them earnestly if they're really OK with it.\n\nTime and again, over and over, recall that he pledged to lower prices and improve Americans' financial lots -- to usher in a whole new golden age of wealth. Then encourage random acts of arithmetic: Are they richer since Trump's election? Do tariff roulette and the stock market roller coaster persuade them that they will be? The questions answer themselves.\n\nMention Elon Musk. Then mention him a dozen more times. Don't worry about what to call him -- oligarch, obnoxious -- and dwell instead on his deeds, which haven't so much put the federal government on a diet as starved the country of the support necessary to stay ahead in medicine, in technological innovation, in higher education, in all the endeavors that made us the affluent envy of the world.\n\nBring up Pete Hegseth and the mess around him, which exemplifies a broader chaos. The way I read the latest polling, some voters who wagered on Trump's rashness as the handmaiden to bold change are realizing that it's kissing cousins with incompetence. Affirm that epiphany. No expletives required.\n\nDraw attention to the children who've been deported despite being U.S. citizens, to the Tufts student snatched from the street, to the immigrants banished to a hellhole in El Salvador without adequate cause or appropriate legal review. Call this by its name: sadism. Wonder aloud if Americans are comfortable with such cruelty. And if maybe, just maybe, they experience a twitch of fear when they contemplate where all of this could lead.\n\nThe discussion among and about Democrats who are trying to stop Trump from ravaging this country casts the formulation of a strategy as more challenging than it needs to be -- as an operation whose success depends on perfectly chosen emissaries and a perfectly honed script. It mistakes the urgency of the mission for the difficulty of it.\n\nChart Trump's excesses and sloppiness. He has taken false steps aplenty, and there will, scarily, be many more where those came from. He can't help himself. That will help Democrats mightily.\n\nMeasure the damage. It's profound. Note that there are better ways to govern. Lay them out succinctly, with an awareness of voters' limited attention, an absence of partisan jargon and an abundance of common sense.\n\nWorry later about which leaders from which wing of the party will use which tools to pick up the pieces. All that matters now is hurrying to that point.\n\nFor the Love of Sentences\n\nI exiled Trump talk from this section of my previous newsletter, on April 17. So I'll begin with it this time.\n\nIn USA Today, Rex Huppke pondered the president's rambling reverie about \"an old-fashioned term that we use -- groceries\" and his definition of it as \"a bag with different things in it.\" \"Jiminy Crickets,\" Huppke wrote, \"the cheese has slid so far off this guy's cracker that it hit the floor and the dog ate it.\" (Thanks to Martin B. Copenhaver of Woodstock, Vt., and Frank W. Leonard of Seattle for flagging this.)\n\nIn The Dispatch, Kevin D. Williamson marveled at Trump's \"delicate little ego, which is always balanced precipitously on the brink of disaster like the scoop atop a wobbly toddler's ice cream cone in July.\" (Michael Smith, Georgetown, Ky.)\n\nIn The New Yorker, Jill Lepore surveyed the destruction of the past three months: \"Trump felled so much timber not because of the mightiness of his ax but because of the rot within the trees and the weakness of the wood.\" (Stan Shatenstein, Montreal)\n\nIn The Washington Post, Ron Charles weighed in: \"Trump's tariffs, like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, are simultaneously dead and alive. But that's hardly a fair comparison. Quantum mechanics is so much easier to understand than the whims and rages of the elderly golf enthusiast who sometimes pops by the White House to savage Americans' retirement savings.\" (Maria Wulff, Portland, Ore., and Terry Grant, McGregor, Texas, among others)\n\nAlso in The Washington Post, David Von Drehle got the jitters from Elon Musk: \"Like a lot of eccentric rich guys in history, the middle-aged Musk could be leaking radiator fluid on the highway of life.\" Also, regarding Musk's and his brethren's grandiose alarmism: \"Tech bros fancy apocalypses the way 6-year-old girls fancy unicorns.\" (Gary Brauch, Los Altos Hills, Calif.)\n\nIn his newsletter, No Mercy/No Malice, Scott Galloway reviewed Trump's driving skills: \"A blackout drunk is behind the wheel of the U.S. economy. All around us, horns (bear markets; consumer confidence plummeting to historic lows) are blaring. In the back seat is a cultist (G.O.P.) who thinks the red lights Trump has blown through, and the accidents in his wake, are baller moves. Also in the back seat: a sulking teen (Democrats) who's visibly upset but can't articulate what they want or suggest a better route. Riding shotgun, though, is an adult the driver can't ignore, the bond market.\" (Steve Carmine, Centennial, Colo.)\n\nIn The Atlantic, Quinta Jurecic acknowledged Americans' apprehensions that Trump might at some point defy an order from the Supreme Court: \"Ultimately, asking what would happen in such a circumstance is like consulting the Monopoly rule book for instructions about what to do if somebody flips over the board.\" (Jeanne Sturges, Peterborough, N.H., and Kate Longaker, Atlanta, among others)\n\nAlso in The Atlantic, Helen Lewis chronicled the hubbub after the writer Douglas Murray used an appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" to challenge Rogan's offering a platform to conspiracy theorists: \"The podcast world has experienced levels of sniping that make the 'Real Housewives' franchise look like the Bretton Woods conference.\" (Tom Williford, Marshall, Minn., and Eric L. Johnson, Chapel Hill, N.C.)\n\nIn The Guardian, Arwa Mahdawi mined the significance of Gwyneth Paltrow's reintroduction of low-cost starches to her diet: \"Perhaps they are a subtle recession indicator? With Trump's tariffs poised to make everything more expensive, I cannoli imagine that we're going to see a lot of people cutting back on meat and eating more pasta.\" (Gail Smith, Wilmington, Del.)\n\nIn her newsletter, Fresh Hell, Tina Brown reacted to an invitation from someone decades younger than she: \"A friend of mine in her 40s hosted a birthday party last week at New York's most glamorous new club with the dress code of 'drop-dead sexy,' which gave me a burst of insecurity. People in my circle are very good at 'drop dead.' Sexy, not so much.\" (Rich Moche, Brookline, Mass.)\n\nIn The Times, Sapna Maheshwari examined how many college athletes like Jake Dailey are pitched on, and tempted by, lucrative social-media opportunities: \"Mr. Dailey, who has 90,000 TikTok followers and 32,000 on Instagram, said he would be thrilled to become a full-time influencer. Otherwise, he plans to become a dentist.\" (Charles Kelley, Merrimack, N.H.)\n\nAnd in The Washington Post, Sebastian Smee appraised an exhibition at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts: \"It is devoted to Vincent van Gogh's portraits of a single family. I came out of it with a full heart not so much warmed as wobbly and exposed, like a freshly shucked oyster.\" (Brad Niebling, Pebble Beach, Calif.)\n\nTo nominate favorite bits of recent writing from The Times or other publications to be mentioned in \"For the Love of Sentences,\" please email me here and include your name and place of residence.\n\nWhat I'm Writing, Reading and Doing\n\nIn another life I wrote extensively about religion -- especially the Roman Catholic Church -- and even for a few years covered the Vatican. So I had thoughts aplenty about Pope Francis' legacy, and I collected some of them in this guest essay in The Times about his statements and positions regarding gay people.\n\nMy latest book, \"The Age of Grievance,\" about the indiscriminate rage that's corrupting American politics and corroding America itself, will be released in paperback on May 13. This revised edition takes into account the 2024 election results and notes how much the national conversation about Luigi Mangione said about who we are today.\n\nDuring my time at The Times, I've been blessed with superb editors. Among the sharpest and kindest was Honor Jones, who is now (drats!) at The Atlantic and has written an enormously moving first novel, \"Sleep,\" which will be published on May 13. The story of a young mother coming to terms with her own mother's failures, it's a testament to Honor's ear for language, gentle touch and deep wisdom.\n\nOn May 27 in Chapel Hill, N.C., I'll be interviewing the historian Molly Worthen about her exciting new book, \"Spellbound: How Charisma Shaped American History From the Puritans to Donald Trump.\" Details are here.\n\nOn May 29 in Asheville, N.C., I'll be interviewed onstage about \"The Age of Grievance\" and more by Tom Fiedler, the former executive editor of The Miami Herald and the former dean of journalism at Boston University's College of Communication. Details are here.\n\nOn a Personal (by Which I Mean Regan) Note\n\nI hugely appreciate the emails from many of you asking about Regan's healing from her knee surgery in November. I'm happy to report that she has finally completed what seems to be a full recovery.\n\nJust in time to surrender to old age and to sputter for that reason.\n\nMy furry beloved always had a lazy streak -- she always balanced or contradicted our 90-minute or two-hour walks with occasions when she hopped onto the bed at 8 p.m. and didn't leave it until 2 p.m. the next day. But I'm telling you, this is different.\n\nShe sleeps harder than ever. She moves less. Even if she has had just a 40-minute walk in the early morning, she'll sometimes decline a second outing in the late afternoon. She wants to loll on the front stoop instead. It's not that she's in any distress; trust me, I know her. It's just that she's 11 years old.\n\nAnd I find her more endearing than ever.\n\nI always wondered if, when she slowed down, I'd mourn the Regan who bolted so reliably after squirrels and deer, who made so many deviations and digressions on a woodland walk that she logged thrice the miles I did, who was such an athletic wonder to behold.\n\nBut no. Her tamer tics amuse me in new ways. She seems to remember the weeks, just after that surgery, when I carried her upstairs, and now, on one of every three nights, she ascends the steps at a sloth's pace, pausing repeatedly to look back at me and see if maybe I'd like to pick her up and save her the effort. I nudge her along, less for my back than for her conditioning. She has to use those muscles lest she lose those muscles.\n\nHer hard sleeping means hard dreaming: She chirps, moans and murmurs, unconsciously narrating her adventures. She also does more phantom running than she used to; her paws drum my side. Ours is an increasingly percussive partnership, its beat evolving, its beauty enduring.",

            "body": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth laid out a plan of action for reinstating servicemembers who were forced out of the military by former President Biden's COVID vaccine mandate.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday ordered a top-down transformation of the Army in a sweeping directive aimed at reorienting the service toward great power competition.\n\nWith a sharp focus on countering China, developing space and counter-space capabilities, and accelerating the Pentagon's new Golden Dome strategy, the aggressive modernization effort directs the Army to cut aging legacy systems, restructure headquarters commands and more rapidly field new technologies.\n\nThe memo ordered a merging of Army Futures Command, based in Austin, Texas, with Training and Doctrine Command, headquartered in Fort Eustis, Virginia, and merging Forces Command, U.S. Army North and U.S. Army South.\n\n\"To build a leaner, more lethal force, the Army must transform at an accelerated pace by divesting outdated, redundant, and inefficient programs, as well as restructuring headquarters and acquisition systems,\" Hegseth wrote.\n\nNEW ARMY SECRETARY PRAISES TRUMP, HEGSETH FOR CREATING 'A LANE FOR CHANGE' AS HE ZEROES IN ON CUTTING WASTE\n\n\"Simultaneously, the Army must prioritize investments in accordance with the Administration's strategy, ensuring existing resources are prioritized to improve long-range precision fires, air and missile defense including through the Golden Dome for America, cyber, electronic warfare, and counter-space capabilities.\"\n\nHegseth wants the Army to be able to field long-range missiles capable of striking moving land and sea targets and achieve electromagnetic and air-littoral dominance by 2027 as the potential for conflict looms in the Indo-Pacific theater.\n\nThe memo calls for reducing manned attack helicopter formations in favor of inexpensive drone swarms and the reduction of general officer positions to focus command structures on the warfighter.\n\nHEGSETH SENDS STRONG MESSAGE TO IRAN AND HOUTHIS: 'YOU WILL PAY'\n\nHegseth ordered the Army to enable AI-driven command and control at theater, corps and division headquarters by 2027 and expand 3D printing for weapons.\n\nThe memo also calls for bulking up the Army's presence in the Indo-Pacific and more joint exercises with allies in the region.\n\nThe procurement of obsolete systems will be ended, per the memo, and \"redundant or ineffective\" programs will be canceled or scaled back, including manned aircraft and excess ground vehicles like the Humvee.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Army will review and cancel inefficient contracts and work to shift from program-centric funding to capability-based funding, and add right to repair provisions in all contracts, as well as implement performance-based contracting to reduce waste.\n\nThe defense secretary also calls for reforms to hiring and firing systems, and reduced spending on climate initiatives, legacy sustainment initiatives and excess travel.",

            "body": "One of my great amusements in life is watching and listening to the Democrats when they've lost an election. It is usually the same story, but it's more pronounced now with Donald Trump as president. We are going to hear the following for the next year-and-a-half or so before the midterms: Trump is a dictator, Nazi, fascist and bully, among other things.\n\nThe mainstream press will join in, of course. They will say Trump is only for the rich and does not care about the rest of the population. And then they are going to divide people by talking about white privilege and how whites want to prevent minorities from voting. They'll say Trump and his supporters want to gather up Black people, put them in chains and send them to Africa. They will also try to bribe voters, like they did when Joe Biden tried to forgive student loans.\n\nThe Democrats lost the presidential election in 2024 for a very simple reason: In Biden, we had by far the worst human being and president we have ever had. Then we had a joke of a candidate in Harris. Added to that, people are tired of the woke agenda, including the sky-is-falling climate change propaganda, open borders and endless wars, to name just a few. The Democrats will always blame others and say the American people are too stupid to understand their agenda. But Americans do understand the Democrats' agenda -- and they've rejected it.\n\nThe Democrats will never accept that they're the reason they lost this election and they'll never change. Hopefully the wimpy Republicans will take this opportunity to come up with and implement a sane agenda after four years of insanity and chaos under Biden.",

Their rhetoric is simply not in accordance with American values. By acting this way, they have obtusely been weakening themselves and strengthening the GOP.\n\nThose who agree with them are, of course, free to do so -- but it's important to keep in mind that the \"Progressives\" are not really a party at all. Their plan is simply to continue tearing down the Democratic Party until they've created a sort of party by default. But to make that happen, they must constantly attack the president's national security-focused agenda and have you believe the president is wrong.\n\nThe truth is, under our current commander in chief, we are all already safer and our country is about to become a lot stronger. It's proof yet again that action speaks a lot louder than words.",

            "body": "The former prime minister can't quite believe the world will keep spinning without his trademark well-timed interventions\n\nPolling day. A day when power reverts temporarily to the people. A day when newspapers send photographers to snap the cutest dogs outside church halls and schools. A day when not much stirs in Westminster.\n\nPolling day. A day when even those not voting catch a lucky break. The rules of purdah apply. So switch on the TV or radio and you'll be spared the sound of politicians talking. Either trying to tell you that everything is working as it should or that it isn't. A day off from the binary reductiveness of political discourse. A chance to reflect on what really matters. Or just to forget.\n\nBut not everywhere was totally silent. Press your ear against the front door of No 10 and you could hear some muffled shouts. Walk inside and you would find the cellar door padlocked. Twice, for good measure. Keir Starmer was determined this particular occupant was not going to be allowed out for a good few days. The prime minister had always been keen on the importance of lessons learned.\n\nBehind the cellar door, sobbing in the dark, sat Tony Blair. Unable to quite believe it had come to this. The l\u00e8se-majest\u00e9. Tony was used to being heard. When he talked, the world was meant to listen. Only, for the last 24 hours, he had been taken prisoner. Locked in the dark. Heavily medicated.\n\n\"It's for your own good,\" said Pat McFadden. Tony had known he was in deep trouble the moment he had heard the voice of Starmer's enforcer-in-chief. Even the terrifying Morgan McSweeney would have been preferable to The Pat in the Hat. McFadden had only once been known to smile in the years he had been in parliament. And that was when he had been sent out to kneecap a Labour MP for speaking out of turn. Pat had thought he had been doing the man a favour by not waterboarding him. Something Tony would have appreciated. Euphoric recall from his Iraq glory days.\n\nTony was near breaking point. Pleading to be let out. Only yesterday he had been a man of substance. A former prime minister revered by many in the Labour party. Now he had been kidnapped. Spirited away by the heavies in No 10. Regarded by many as just a useful idiot for Reform and the Conservatives.\n\nHow would the world still spin on its axis without yet another very important intervention from him? More importantly, the Gulf states could stop funding his institute if he were suddenly to go quiet on fossil fuels. He had learned long ago never to pay for anything himself. Only mugs did that.\n\n\"It's for your own good,\" yelled enforcer-in-chief Pat McFadden. \"What you've got to learn, old man, is that you're past it. Not just yesterday's man, but the day before yesterday's man. No one is interested in what you have to say any more. You're completely out of your depth. You no longer understand the modern world. You're an embarrassment to the Labour party. Worse, you're an embarrassment to yourself. So we're going to have to put you through a re-education programme.\"\n\nAnything, Tony had mumbled. Anything. Just let him out into the light. Put him back in front of the people.\n\nPat the Hat shook his head. Tony just wasn't getting it. There would be no more media appearances. He would have to take a virtual vow of silence. And anything he did say would have to be personally cleared by him. To make sure he wasn't about to stray off message yet again. Time for another dose of fentanyl. Tony's eyes half closed, his pupils no more than pin-pricks. His voice sedated to a slur. When I said that the government's net zero strategy was doomed to failure without fossil fuels my brain had been captured by Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, Tony stumbled. What I really meant was the complete opposite.\n\n\"Of course you did,\" said Pat the Hat. \"But that's better. A good start. Two more weeks of solitary and we might just be able to let you out under close supervision.\" Tears welled up in Tony's eyes. He wasn't sure he was going to last that long.\n\nThere were also partial signs of life in parliament, where the Commons was going through the motions with business and trade departmental questions. Though there was an odd sense of calm about it all. No one got angry. No one really challenged any of the ministers on anything. It was all a bit like politics used to be before the psychodramas of the last 10 years. When the half-witted became the new normal and we skipped through several news cycles in a single day.\n\nTo listen to the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and his ministerial sidekicks, all was entirely well with the world. Britain had never had it so good. Of course we were going to export more to everyone. The fun times were only minutes away. The desolation of the 14 years of Tory government would soon be just a distant memory. A US trade deal was imminent. And why wouldn't it be, because Agent Orange was clearly a totally rational man. We would get the bigliest, bestest deal ever. Everything was going our way. So much so, there was no need to give parliament a vote on any new treaty because everyone would love it anyway.\n\nAll was also well with the EU. There would be no need for us to align with Europe because Europe would be aligning with us. We would never lower our standards for anyone apart from the countries with whom we needed to lower standards. And so on. The weird thing was that the opposition parties by and large went along with this. There was no fight. No pushback. Just a sense of nothingness. As if nothing really mattered. Perhaps the Tories were just too busy contemplating their probable annihilation in the local elections. No point tempting hubris.\n\nStill, it was all somehow reassuring. The world as we would like it to be. When we can let the politicians do politics without our need to keep a close eye on them. Just a shame it was only for one day. Tomorrow we'll almost certainly find out the world is every bit as perilous as we thought it was.",

            "body": "Years ago, Chief Justice John Roberts joined a decision in favor of Obamacare. Although many believed the ruling defied common sense, Roberts explained that it was not the court's job to correct ballot-box mistakes. That was then. Today we have a different president, elected by a landslide, and a gang of judges stifling his every effort to preside and do his constitutional duty. This behavior flagrantly exceeds their authority, and Chief Justice Roberts seems to see nothing wrong with it.\n\nDouble standards aside, rogue judges are nothing new. A lifetime ago, we had an unwritten rule that juries decided points of fact and judges decided points of law. This meant juries found defendants negligent (or not) and judges ruled on how much, if anything, to award plaintiffs as damages. They couldn't very well add on huge sums for pain and suffering; they'd risk being overruled. Then came an idea: Why not allow juries to decide damage amounts? Since appellate courts seldom overrule juries, the scam prospered. It paved the way for courts to create new currency by fiat, worth no more than Monopoly money, and flood the economy with it. Congress and the Federal Reserve have been unable to stanch the resulting inflation.\n\nThat's one instance. For its part, the Supreme Court has had one or two famously bad chief justices. Given these, we can no longer ignore a gaping hole in the Constitution, hiding in plain sight. It provides no effective procedure for calling rogue or incompetent judges and justices to account. In today's overwrought climate, correcting this will require exceptional leadership and integrity, of the sort never seen before.",

            "body": "Sometimes we don't want high concepts and wow factor; we'll settle for a simple, thoughtfully told story with likeable and well-drawn characters. Going by the first two episodes of Four Seasons, that's definitely the case with this enjoyably staged dramedy (remaking Alan Alda's 1981 film of the same name) centred around three well-off married couples: Kate (Tina Fey) and Jack (Will Forte); Nick (Steve Carell) and Anne (Kenney-Silver); and Danny (Colman Domingo) and Claude (Marco Calvani).\n\nThe primary source of dramatic tension in those early episodes involves Nick planning to divorce Anne, while, at the same time, she's planning a surprise vow renewal ceremony. Awkward.\n\nFilm, USA, 2022 - out 7 May\n\nRobert Eggers has made a career of injecting fusty old narratives - about witches (The Witch), vampires (Nosferatu) and mermaids (The Lighthouse) - with new life and an uncynical appreciation of lore and legend. Taking on the Norse myth that inspired Shakespeare to write Hamlet, The Northman was an attempt, in the writer/director's own words, to make \"the definitive Viking movie\".\n\nThis very trippy and violent revenge story follows Amleth (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd), a warrior determined to avenge his father and reclaim his kingdom. It's a stunningly realised work, visceral and lyrical.\n\nFilm, Australia, 2024 - out 16 May\n\nAs I wrote last year: \"Horror movies directed by Indigenous Australians are a largely rare category of cinema, immediately making Jon Bell's Stolen Generations-themed spook-fest The Moogai a work of cultural significance.\" The film is a bumpy ride, far from the allegorical masterpiece many were hoping for, though it's still worth a watch, with plenty to contemplate afterwards. Shari Sebbens leads the cast as Sarah, an Aboriginal lawyer who gives birth to a second child and is haunted by the eponymous monster.\n\nHonourable mentions: Past Lives (film, out now), Cuckoo (film, 8 May), Nonnas (film, 9 May), Bet (TV, 15 May), Love, Death & Robots season 4 (TV, 15 May), Bet season 1 (TV, 15 May), Sirens (TV, 22 May), Fear Street: Prom Queen (film, 23 May), Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders (TV, out 26 May), Aunty Donna's Coffee Caf\u00e9 (TV, 30 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 8 May\n\nThe \"howdunit\" is a rare format (most memorably deployed in Columbo) whereby the audience witnesses a crime being committed, then watches the detective put the pieces together. The second season of Poker Face marks the return of Natasha Lyonne's irresistibly sassy Charlie Cale, a former casino employee pursued by murderous goons, who has a supernatural ability to tell when somebody's lying.\n\nThe on-the-run premise enables a steady influx of new characters and settings. Season two begins with a fun story centred around sextuplets (all played by Cynthia Erivo), involving impersonations, inheritance and, of course, good ol' fashioned murder.\n\nHonourable mentions: Jojo Rabbit (film, 4 May), The Walking Dead: Dead City season two (TV, 5 May), Red Rocket (film, 6 May), Titanic (film, 17 May), Gnomeo & Juliet (film, 17 May), Borat (film, 24 May), Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (film, 24 May), Kevin Costner's The West (TV, 28 May), Behind the Candelabra (film, 29 May), Sing Sing (film, 31 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 8 May\n\nThe famous sleuth at 221B Baker Street continues to tossed and turned in the zeitgeist, every generation receiving new variations of Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic character. And it's not just Holmesy who's reinvented but also his colleagues and fam. This year has seen the arrival of the medical drama Watson, following Holmes' longtime assistant, and now a show introducing Amelia (Blu Hunt), a Native American woman who believes that Sherlock (David Thewlis) is her biological father. He's dismissive but, with Watson having disappeared, is in need of an assistant and, well, you know where this is going ...\n\nFilm, Japan, 2017 - out now\n\nThis fiendishly inventive and super-meta Japanese horror flick begins with an audacious, unbroken 37-minute take, capturing what appears to be the production of a low-budget zombie movie that's interrupted by the arrival of actual zombies. Credits roll - and then we get to see what happened before the shoot and what really happened during it. A funny, shrewd, zany film.\n\nHonourable mentions: Gomorrah seasons one to five (TV, out now), Blood Diamond (film, out now), Contact (film, out now), Mars Attacks! (film, out now), Patrick (film, out now), Something's Gotta Give (film, out now), The Black Forest Murders (TV, 8 May), The Eurovision Song Contest 2025 (TV, 14-18 May), The Veil (TV, 27 May).\n\nTV, UK, 2025 - out now\n\nIn my household, the arrival of a new season of this long-running British panel show is a big deal. I've not only exhausted every episode released in recent years but watched many twice. Predicated on guests relaying strange stories that may or may not be true, it's always laugh-out-loud funny, with hilarious, finely honed chemistry between the host, Rob Brydon, and the team captains Lee Mack and David Mitchell.\n\nHonourable mentions: Bergerac season one (TV, 4 May), Return to Belsen (film, 5 May), The Kimberley (TV, 13 May), Gruen season 17 (TV, 14 May), The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (film, 18 May), Picasso season one (TV, 26 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 22 May\n\nThe first season of Nine Perfect Strangers played like Agatha Christie at a wellness resort, following a group of strangers carefully selected by Nicole Kidman's Masha - a mysterious Russian guru with cult leader vibes. Her methods are a mite unconventional, including secretly feeding her guests psychedelic substances.\n\nI found the whole thing deliciously entertaining and moreish, so I'm looking forward to the second season, which is based in the Austrian Alps. The official synopsis promises that nine new suckers, er, strangers, will be \"connected in ways they could never imagine\" by old mate Masha, who'll \"try anything in the interest of healing everyone involved, including herself\".\n\nFilm, USA, 2025 - out now\n\nAnna Kendrick and Blake Lively shared memorable chemistry as young mums and frenemies in Paul Weig's twisty, spritzy neo-noir A Simple Favor, which centres around the mysterious disappearance of Lively's charismatic and flighty Emily.\n\nThe plot of the sequel has Kendrick's Stephanie (now a true crime author) and Emily (freshly released from prison) visiting the island of Capri, Italy, where murder and mayhem ensue. It reportedly delivers more absurd twists. While the Guardian's Adrian Horton says it \"does not match the intoxicating magic of the original\" she also calls it \"confidently ridiculous\" and \"stylishly absurd\".\n\nHonourable mentions: Misery (film, out now), Teen Wolf 1 and 2 (film, out now), The Birdcage (film, out now), Mad Max: Fury Road (film, 6 May), Octopus! (film, 8 May), Kraven the Hunter (film, 12 May), Overcompensating (TV, 15 May), Motorheads (TV, 20 May), Edge of Tomorrow (film, 20 May), Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (film, 27 May), The Better Sister (TV, 29 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 16 May\n\nFans of Lost may be pleased to know that Duster reunites its co-creator JJ Abrams and star Josh Holloway. Pegged as \"a throwback to classic 70s crime shows\", the series is set in the south-west of the US in 1971 and follows the FBI's first female Black agent (Rachel Hilsin) as she teams up with a getaway driver (Holloway) to combat a crime syndicate. The trailer features funkalicious clothes, skidding wheels and jivey tunes.\n\nHonourable mentions: The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (film, 3 May), Jay & Pamela (TV, 6 May), Pee-Wee as Himself (TV, 24 May), Rick and Morty season eight (TV, 26 May), And Just Like That ... season three (TV, 30 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 29 May\n\nRemember that period in your life when you were kind of OK with sharing a toothbrush with a friend? Adults, which was formerly titled Snowflakes, is about this time, following a group of twentysomethings in New York who do twentysomething stuff. The show's official synopsis claims it puts \"a slightly heightened twist on the wins, losses and humiliations of starting out in the adult world\".\n\nHonourable mentions: Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld (TV, 4 May), FX's Welcome to Wrexham season 4 (TV, 16 May), Tucci in Italy (TV, 19 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 16 May\n\nThe protagonist of this twisted sci-fi series based on Martha Wells' books The Murderbot Diaries is a bizarre creation: a robot (Alexander Skarsg\u00e5rd) that hacks its own firmware, enabling it to disobey instructions and do its own thing. Which sounds liberating but, if people realise this hunk of bolts has true autonomy, it'll almost certainly be destroyed.\n\nMurderbot must, therefore, hide its independence and suck it up, while protecting a group of hippy-ish scientists working on a planet where there are terrible insect-like monsters the size of cargo ships. I'm only two episodes in but, already, I'm pretty sure I've never encountered a character quite like this. Murderbot's personality is brought to life through excessively whiny voiceover narration, dropping a tonne of misanthropic lines - like \"Stupid fucking humans!\" and \"These people, honestly!\"\n\nFilm, USA, 2024 - out 16 May\n\nThe director of An Inconvenient Truth, Davis Guggenheim, teams up with deaf actor and activist Nyle DiMarco for this documentary about a week of protests held at Gallaudet University - the world's only deaf university - 1988. They were triggered by four students responding to the university board's decision to select a hearing president, which the school had done for 124 years. The Hollywood Reporter calls it \"a fine entry\" in the \"birth of a movement\" genre, and Variety a \"propulsive nonfiction story\" that \"feels as inspirational as any scripted feature\".\n\nHonourable mentions: Long Way Home (TV, 9 May), Fountain of Youth (film, 23 May), Bono: Stories of Surrender (film, 30 May).\n\nFilm, Australia, 2025 - out 30 May\n\nI doubt anybody was champing at the bit for the cinematic return of Johnny \"Spit\" Spitieri, the criminal and former heroin addict hilariously played by David Wenham in the 2003 Australian film Gettin' Square. But, gawd luv 'im, it's good to see the dodgy bugger back on screens in his very own spin-off feature.\n\nIt's not an amazing movie but, as I wrote in my review, it's enjoyably low-key and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, the plot revolving around Spitieri being arrested after trying to return to Australia. Goons want him gone forever; cops want his assistance; Spit just wants to do his own thing.\n\nHonourable mentions: The Trouble With Harry (film, 1 May), Beaches (film, 1 May), Ghost Cat Anzu (film, 5 May), Strife season two (TV, 8 May), Kraven the Hunter (film, 12 May), Saturday Night (film, 29 May).",

            "title": "Is the UK's energy storage growing fast enough?",
            "body": "Britain's booming green energy generation has a costly side-effect: the national electricity system operator has had to compensate wind turbine operators that could have produced more clean electricity than the grid could take.\n\nThe cost of paying windfarms to temporarily switch off rose significantly in early 2025, surpassing \u00a3250 million in the first two months of the year. This figure not only includes these \"constraint payments\" to windfarm operators, but also payments to gas power plants to switch on and meet demand in the south of England that could theoretically be met by wind energy.\n\nWind power is often generated in remote areas like the Scottish Highlands, where there is low electricity demand. To transmit this power over long distances to areas of higher demand (mostly in the south of England) requires power lines, but these have transmission limits and there are not enough of them.\n\nBritain will only make effective use of its energy potential if grid-scale energy storage keeps pace with the expansion of new windfarms and other forms of intermittent renewable energy, such as solar.\n\nLarge-scale battery systems, pumped hydro and other storage methods could capture the excess energy injected by windfarms on windy days and release it when needed. But are these energy storage options arriving quickly enough?\n\nWhy is storage so important?\n\nMost British consumers will not see a significant change in how they use electricity with the introduction of planned storage installations, other than fewer blips in power quality, such as flickering or dimming lights.\n\nYou might spot these new energy storage facilities in rows of what look like shipping containers but are actually batteries. And the national grid (which serves England, Wales and Scotland - Northern Ireland has a separate electricity network) will be more capable of responding quickly to even minor variations in electricity supply and demand, meaning fewer headlines about curtailed windfarms.\n\nThe UK government is aiming to build up to 27 gigawatts of battery storage by 2030 (in 2023, battery capacity was estimated to be around 5 gigawatts). There are applications totalling 59 gigawatts of battery storage in the connections queue for 2030.\n\nSome of these are speculative - introduced to secure connection slots and permissions, with the intention of selling the rights on. These connections will not necessarily be built, yet contribute to long delays in approvals.\n\nAs a result, the energy regulator Ofgem has been working with network operators to reform the connections queue. This includes new rules and more coordination between grid operators and project developers, as well as incentives (such as lower connection charges) to encourage battery developers to ensure their output can be adjusted to accommodate network constraints when necessary.\n\nHaving substantial grid-scale energy storage could help stabilise electricity prices, which might give households lower and less volatile bills. It would also reduce the need to fire up gas generators during supply lulls, lowering the influence of expensive imported gas on electricity prices.\n\nOptions and opportunities\n\nStoring excess renewable energy involves a range of technologies. Short-duration storage options such as batteries can supply energy ranging from seconds to a few hours. Long-duration storage, such as pumped hydro, can supply energy for several hours, days or more.\n\nPumped hydro is the oldest long-duration storage technology. It involves storing vast amounts of energy by pumping water to a higher reservoir when electricity is plentiful, and releasing it to a lower reservoir through a turbine when needed. Dinorwig in north Wales and Cruachan in western Scotland are capable of storing 9 and 7 gigawatt-hours of energy, respectively.\n\nMajor expansions are planned, such as the new pumped hydro storage scheme Coire Glas in Scotland. Expected to be completed around 2030-31, it is designed to store 30 gigawatt-hours, adding vast reserves of energy to the grid.\n\nBritain's largest grid-scale battery installation, the Minety battery storage project completed in 2022 in Wiltshire, southern England, is capable of absorbing or delivering 150 megawatts - roughly equivalent to the power demand of 450,000 UK households.\n\nWhile Britain is making progress with its storage infrastructure, other countries are scaling up rapidly. China has built huge pumped hydro stations and the US is deploying very large grid-scale batteries. Germany, meanwhile, is testing hydrogen storage to absorb the power from its onshore windfarms.\n\nNew forms of storage\n\nThere is a drive by energy companies to develop new forms of long-duration storage. Along with hydrogen, liquid\u2011air storage is capable of inter-seasonal storage. This would allow solar energy collected during the summer to be available for release during the duller autumn and winter months.\n\nIn liquid-air plants, excess electricity is used to cool air to a liquid which can then be stored in insulated tanks. When electricity is required, the liquid air is heated and turned back into a gas, which moves a turbine and generates electricity. A 50-megawatt liquid-air plant planned near Manchester is expected to start commercial operation in 2026.\n\nIn hydrogen energy storage plants, surplus electricity powers an electrolyser that splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is stored and, when electricity is needed, fed into a fuel cell or turbine to generate the electricity. An example is the proposed Aldbrough facility in east Yorkshire, which is expected to be in operation by 2030 and will have a storage capacity of 320 gigawatt-hours. This facility will use three repurposed salt caverns originally developed to store natural gas.\n\nEnergy storage technology has become a serious business opportunity, with companies investing billions of pounds into building new facilities. The variety of projects in the pipeline suggests the UK will be better able to avoid curtailing wind energy in the future, even accounting for growth in wind power capacity. Paying windfarm operators to switch off may soon be a thing of the past.\n\nDon't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?\n\nGet a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.
