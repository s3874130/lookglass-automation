            "title": "Could West Australians again hold the keys to the Lodge?",
            "body": "Western Australia has a reputation for moving at a slower pace.\n\nOur capital city is known as a big country town, WA sometimes stands for Wait Awhile, and visiting comedians thank us for going to their \"late-night\" shows at 8.30pm.\n\nWe were the last colony to join the Australian federation in 1901. And on Saturday, we'll be the last to vote in the election.\n\nBut 2022 has become a stark reminder of why the audience shouldn't leave the stadium before Westralia runs its race.\n\nIn a tight sprint to the finish at the last federal election, it was WA's votes which pushed Anthony Albanese into the Lodge.\n\nYes, our time zone means the federal election could technically be over while we're still scrambling to the polling booths.\n\nBut if the race is close, sandgropers could once again be the kingmakers of this federal election.\n\nWA priorities clear\n\nThe campaign has been all about the cost of living, but there are a few issues specific to WA.\n\nOnce a political afterthought, the state has become a prime location for politicians racking up frequent-flyer points.\n\nAnthony Albanese has made a point of visiting WA more than 30 times during his prime ministership.\n\nPeter Dutton has accumulated less points, but has frequented the state more lately.\n\nBoth Labor and the Liberals have agreed to uphold WA's GST deal, which will cost the federal budget a measly $53 billion (and counting) over 10 years through to 2029-30. West Aussies can breathe a sigh of relief there.\n\nPeter Dutton has also promised to \"turbocharge\" jobs and investment in the mining and resources sector.\n\nThe seats on the line\n\nLet's take a look at where the federal priorities lie.\n\nWestern Australia is home to the country's only new electorate this election -- Bullwinkel.\n\nIt's a mish-mash of suburban and rural voters, spanning from the rural Wheatbelt to the city's fringe.\n\nThe diversity of issues in an electorate so wide-ranging makes it a difficult race to pick between Labor, Liberal, and the Nationals.\n\nWestern Australia is also home to the country's most marginal teal independent seat -- affluent, beachside Curtin.\n\nThe Liberal Party have deployed former international Uber executive Tom White to take on Climate 200-backed Kate Chaney.\n\nFormer dolphin trainer (and police officer) Sam Lim made a splash at the last federal election with a surprise win in the seat of Tangney.\n\nIt's Labor's most marginal seat in the state, previously held by the Liberals since 1984. Liberal candidate Howard Ong will be hoping to flip this key seat in Perth's south back to blue.\n\nIn the seat of Moore, incumbent Liberal-MP-turned-independent Ian Goodenough is threatening to up-end more than three decades of Liberal reign.\n\nMr Goodenough was ousted by his own party at preselection -- a move he said could've ignited a \"civil war\" at the time -- and will be taking on his replacement as Liberal candidate, former army officer Vince Connelly and Labor's Tom French.\n\nThe seat of Fremantle has been red for more than 90 years, held by Labor heavyweights including John Curtin and Kim Beazley Sr.\n\nLabor's Josh Wilson will be looking to maintain that record against an independent -- Kate Hulett -- who came just 424 votes off ousting Labor's state MP in the WA election two months ago.",

            "title": "Two wannabe PMs, a media pack and the search for gold",
            "body": "As Albanese and Dutton crisscrossed the country aiming to win over voters, ABC photographers were there to capture the best images of the campaign.\n\nOver 35 days, politicians have donned hi-vis, sizzled sausages, shaken hands, and cuddled babies. All in the name of winning tomorrow's federal election.\n\nFor the party leaders, their media managers and the journalists accompanying them on the campaign trail, the days are long, the schedule is relentless, and the stakes are high. For the photographers, a large media scrum means muscling into the best position to take the winning image.\n\n\"[The crowd] makes it very, very difficult to navigate and to look for what we call gold -- a gold moment,\" ABC Chief Photographer Brendan Esposito says. Gold, according to the veteran photographer, is a moment of \"authenticity\" when \"the character of the person\" shines through.\n\nBut authentic moments can be hard to find. \"[The leaders] are all smooth, they're really guarded now, and they are polished in their performance, and everything is down to clockwork,\" Esposito says.\n\nEarly in the campaign, Peter Dutton visited the Assyrian New Year festivities at Fairfield in Western Sydney. \"He started to dance with a guy, and it was just a little jig,\" Esposito says. \"It wasn't anything fancy, but it was something that showed this guy, actually he does have humour. There is a lighter side to Peter.\"\n\nIt was a good moment because Peter doesn't give much away, Esposito says. \"My observations with him is that I think he's quite a shy man.\"\n\nLabor's Chris Bowen was at the same event and he and Dutton met unexpectedly. \"Bowen's face said it all. He was visibly uncomfortable,\" Esposito says.\n\nDespite careful choreography from media advisors and advancers, who arrive at a location ahead of time scouting for potential surprises and unwanted signs -- the iconic 2015 image of a beaming Tony Abbott snapped in front of giant yellow letters saying \"The Reject\" springs to mind -- on the campaign trail, sometimes the unexpected happens.\n\nThere was the moment the prime minister fell off a stage in Cessnock, in NSW, which became a Coalition attack point after Anthony Albanese initially said he hadn't fallen. Then there was the stray football Dutton kicked into the head of a camera operator.\n\n\"They like to have things heavily stage managed [but] it's exciting, you just never know what's going to happen,\" says ABC photographer Adam Kennedy, who is covering his sixth federal election.\n\n\"You don't get this access to the PM and the opposition leader out and about doing things throughout the normal political cycle. They'll go do a press conference here and there, but it's nothing like this.\"\n\nA photo can be powerful, it \"can turn an election\", ABC photographer Ian Cutmore believes.\n\nThis campaign, there have been a lot of protesters, he says. Early on a Rising Tide climate protester is shown shouting at Albanese, while on Tuesday, Dutton's plans went awry when anti-nuclear union protesters crashed a press conference in the marginal NSW seat of Gilmore - Dutton was whisked away by his minders and did not speak at the event.\n\n\"It does give you an idea of how fraught campaigning can be when these unexpected moments happen,\" ABC reporter Pablo Viñales said live on air at the time.\n\nThe role of the photographer on the campaign trail is to \"capture the event as well as capturing the person and who they are, to try to show the public what they're like,\" Cutmore says.\n\nFinding ways to illustrate what journalists are talking about can mean looking for the little things -- a gesture or an expression.\n\n\"Albo's got more facial expressions, but Dutton, he's got his head, which is a bit of a character you can just have a bit of fun with,\" Kennedy says.\n\nCutmore agrees. \"It's easier with Albanese because he's usually a bit more dynamic and expressive so he's always got interesting facial expressions and body language and hand gestures but Dutton is a lot harder,\" he says.\n\nThe obligatory photo ops of politicians with babies and children have been plentiful.\n\nFor Kennedy, this image of Albanese meeting three girls in outer Melbourne is his favourite. The girls lived next door to a family Albanese was meeting with, Kennedy says, and they simply ambushed the PM as he was leaving the event.\n\n\"There's a girl with her fingers intertwined like Monty Burns, watching. And then there's this tiny little girl staring up at the prime minister. She's got no fear.... The middle [girl] who's just sort of happy there in front of all these cameras.\"\n\nFor Cutmore, capturing Dutton having fun playing two-up at an RSL in Townsville on Anzac Day is one of his favourites. \"He was talking to all the people in the room. He was just a lot more relaxed and casual.\"\n\nIt can feel ridiculous when 30 members of the media are crowded into a cafe as a politician has a conversation with a family about the cost of living, Matt Roberts says. \"You take a step back and realise how silly and set up a lot of these things are but ...that's part of Australian political history, we've been doing this [campaign style] a long time and in a weird way it's sort of unique and charming.\"",

            "title": "Trump Policies Draw Outrage at May Day Protests Across the U.S.",
            "body": "Orland Mayorquin reported from Los Angeles, Robert Chiarito from Chicago, and Aishvarya Kavi from Washington.\n\nAnnual May Day rallies in cities across the country swelled with thousands of anti-Trump demonstrators on Thursday, as outcry continued to grow over the president's agenda and expansion of executive power.\n\nProtesters denounced the administration's effort to roll back workers' rights -- a particular sore spot on a day dedicated to celebrating organized labor -- as well as plans to cut education funding and carry out mass deportations.\n\n\"We're here to support our workers and our union,\" said Jena Olsen, 63, who has been a flight attendant for 39 years, at a large rally in Chicago's Union Park. But demonstrators said they were also angry about the \"threat to democracy\" posed by President Trump.\n\n\"I think the two coexist,\" Ms. Olsen said, \"and this huge turnout shows that.\"\n\nA separate effort, which organizers billed as a National Law Day of Action, brought legal professionals to the Supreme Court in Washington and federal courthouses across the country on Thursday to push for judicial independence and oppose efforts to intimidate law firms.\n\nThe lawyers demonstrating at the Supreme Court reaffirmed their oaths to serve with integrity and to protect the rule of law -- principles that do not appear to interest Mr. Trump, said Fabiola Gretzinger, 28. \"He thinks he's above it,\" she said.\n\nPolice closed streets for the crowds in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington. But protesters also rallied in small communities that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, including places like Norman, Okla., Sauk City, Wis., and Hendersonville, N.C. Groups held signs in front of municipal buildings and public schools, and some demonstrators wore red to indicate support for public education.\n\nA rally in downtown Los Angeles began early on Thursday and focused largely on migrant rights. Jose Servín, 31, an organizer for a statewide coalition of advocacy groups who helped set up for the rally, held a sign that read, \"Come for one of us, come for all of us.\"\n\nMr. Servin immigrated to the United States as a child, he said. \"I found a place here where I can succeed, where I can thrive, where I can plant roots -- I'm a father now -- and I'm going to fight like hell to protect that,\" he said.\n\nThe protests -- more than 1,000 were expected across the country -- were spearheaded to coincide with traditional May Day labor rallies by 50501, a loose coalition of grass-roots activist groups, as well as by labor, nonprofit and civil rights organizations. May Day commemorates the struggle for an eight-hour workday, won by labor organizers in 1886 only after clashes in Chicago resulted in the deadly Haymarket Riot.\n\nLabor groups made up a significant portion of demonstrators at the rally in Chicago on Thursday, though pro-Palestinian activists and anti-Trump demonstrators swelled their ranks, and many saw their concerns as overlapping.\n\n\"He's tearing apart our Constitution,\" said Bill Hincks, 40, a union official from the Chicago suburb of Oak Forest, who faulted Mr. Trump for firing officials at agencies that regulate workplace safety, including at the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to quell dissent in corporate America, universities, government agencies and the news media. But in recent weeks, demonstrations opposing the president's agenda, as well as resistance from some of the institutions targeted by Mr. Trump, have increased in size and frequency.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat who first ran for office in 2018 because of his revulsion to Mr. Trump's first term, called for an even larger outcry during a speech on Sunday in New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's time to fight everywhere, and all at once,\" he said.\n\nKatie Benner contributed from Washington.",

            "title": "Fernandes at the double as Manchester United cruise against 10-man Athletic Bilbao",
            "body": "Manchester United enjoyed their night in Bilbao so much that they will surely be coming back. They remain the only unbeaten team among the more than 100 that have played in the Europa League over eight long months, and even if they do fall to a first defeat in seven days' time, they should be there on its final game in this same stadium, this season given meaning and potentially a triumphant end.\n\nThey came to the stadium everyone calls the Cathedral and defeated Athletic Club so convincingly that the second leg carries little threat. No one had won here this year in this competition and Athletic had conceded just 10 times in all competitions; United scored three in a quarter of an hour.\n\nAn opening goal from Casmeiro and two from Bruno Frenandes, the first of those from the spot and accompanied by a red card for Dani Viviain, destroyed the dreams of the faithful here and virtually ensured that they will return on 21 May against Spurs or Bodø/Glimt.\n\nUltimately this was an efficient, impressive performance in which United looked something like the team, and club, they are supposed to be: one that can win a European title that has become their salvation and a glimpse, perhaps of future hope, not least as it would give them Champions League access. One that ended up looking on a different level to their opponents.\n\nAthletic had started strongly too, forcing the first corner and the first roar inside 90 seconds. While United sought to slow the game down, the home side wanted to accelerate it. United's possession was not so much a platform for them to do something as for Athletic to, ready to asphyxiate their opponents, rob and then go at them. That front-footed approach, though, did open them to the ball behind and just four minutes in, Manuel Ugarte slipped into the right channel and released Alejandro Garncho scored what he thought was the opener. That was offside, but it was also a warning, an invitation to United to seek the same wing.\n\nIt would work too and repeatedly. André Onana had to save from Alex Berenguer, Iñaki Williams headed just over and when he then raced up the right and pulled back, Victor Lindelof twice had to make decisive interventions. The second of those, made almost on the line with Berenguer shooting from five yards out, really should have been the opener. Instead, having resisted the pressure, the red and white shirts coming at them, it was United that would get it just before the half hour.\n\nIt was made by United's unlikely hero doing unlikely things. More unlikely even than last time, although the moment was not as dramatic. Harry Maguire, the emergency striker who had completed the most astonishing comeback against Lyon, smacking in a header on 121 minutes to send Old Trafford wild, now went all Stanley Matthews to momentarily silence San Mamés. If that had been latter-day Ronaldo, this was more like his teenage incarnation.\n\nFaced by Mikel Jauregizar, Maguire went up the right, stopped, turned one way and the next, then started up again, going past the midfielder and delivering the cross. Manuel Ugarte headed it on and, at the far post, Casemiro arrived to nod into the net. United had a lead that was swiftly doubled, and in a way that gave them even more of an advantage than the goal they scored, two minutes enough to virtually terminate the tie.\n\nAgain, it started on the right, where United had always identified opportunity. When the ball from Noussair Mazraoui came across the six-yard box, Rasmus Højlund went down. Dani Vivian went straight to him and accused him of diving but the defender was protesting too much and if he had got away with it the first time ultimately he would pay for what he had done; Højlund may have been quick to go to ground but there had been a clear hand on his shoulder and when the referee Espen Eskås came back from the VAR screen where he was shown what he had not seen live, he pointed to the spot and pulled out a red card.\n\nVivian departed, Fernandes rolled in the penalty and this, it seemed, was done. Iñaki Williams did bend a shot wide but Athletic appeared gone and United added a third. Højlund scrambled for the ball, Ugarte provided the clever flick and Fernandes ran through to finish high into the net. The lead might even have extended still further before half-time, when Mazraoui smashed one off the bar.\n\nThe protests and the feeling of injustice which accompanied them off at the break increased early in the second when the referee was called to the screen to have another look at the moment when Maguire pulled down Maroan Sannadi. He decided that was no red card, any tiny hope that the numbers might be evened out, and a comeback would start, snuffed out. Instead, United controlled this, never in any danger. They managed it with a certain comfort, a sense of clear superiority, and the threat - if not an actual need - of extending the lead still further. There was another penalty appeal from Højlund, this time tangling with Yuri Berchiche. Ugarte and Casemiro both took aim from distance and the Brazilian put a header against the post.\n\nWilliams went sprinting up the pitch soon after, but Athletic were exhausted now, defeated, and those chances were a reminder that this could still get worse. For Manchester United, it could hardly get any better, and they will surely be back.",

            "body": "Global elites are fast-tracking geoengineering under the guise of \"climate intervention,\" bypassing public scrutiny.\n\nIn a brazen move that defies both science and sanity, geoengineers are now pushing to weaponize commercial airliners in a radical experiment to alter Earth's climate. A new study published in Earth's Future reveals plans to retrofit Boeing 777 jets to dump millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the lower stratosphere -- a scheme that could trigger catastrophic acid rain, poison ecosystems, and accelerate the very environmental collapse it claims to prevent.\n\nThe study, authored by researchers from University College London and Yale, admits the plan would \"strongly increase side-effects such as acid rain\" due to the sheer volume of sulfur required. Unlike high-altitude aerosol injection (SAI), which requires specialized aircraft, this shortcut relies on existing jets flying at just 42,000 feet -- ensuring the toxic particles rain down faster and in greater concentrations.\n\nThe irony is staggering: To \"save\" the planet from climate change, they're willing to flood it with poison.\n\nThe study's authors openly concede that their low-altitude sulfur-dumping strategy is \"sub-optimal\" -- meaning it's less effective, more dangerous, and disproportionately harms polar regions. Yet they advocate for it anyway, citing \"lower technical barriers\" and the ability to deploy faster.\n\nThis isn't science. It's a corporate-military power grab disguised as environmentalism.\n\nThe push for geoengineering is nothing new. For decades, global elites have weaponized weather under the guise of \"environmental stewardship.\" In the 20th century, cloud seeding was used to manipulate rainfall. Now, they've escalated to stratospheric aerosol injection -- a far more dangerous game.\n\nThe study compares the sulfur output to the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which temporarily cooled the planet but also triggered widespread acid rain and ozone depletion. Yet, unlike a natural disaster, this would be a permanent, man-made atmospheric regime -- one that, once started, cannot be stopped without triggering \"termination shock\" -- a sudden, catastrophic warming spike.\n\nThe geoengineering-industrial complex is already lining up for taxpayer-funded contracts. Britain's Aria agency is preparing field experiments, while defense contractors and aerospace giants like Boeing could cash in on retrofitting fleets.\n\nMeanwhile, the public is kept in the dark. No democratic debate. No informed consent. Just a silent coup against the sky itself.\n\nThis isn't about saving the planet. It's about control -- engineering dependence on a toxic, irreversible atmospheric intervention. The same corporate and governmental forces that wrecked the environment with industrialization now seek to \"fix\" it by dousing the skies in sulfur.\n\nAs the study admits, this plan is flawed, dangerous, and inefficient -- yet it's being fast-tracked anyway. The question isn't whether they can do it. The question is: Will we let them, or will government enforce new state laws combating geoengineering?",
