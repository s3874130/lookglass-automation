            "body": "Leftist activists are delusional in thinking they can sway the people of the United States with constant whining, complaining and malice directed at everything Republicans stand for. Their rhetoric is simply not in accordance with American values. By acting this way, they have obtusely been weakening themselves and strengthening the GOP.\n\nThose who agree with them are, of course, free to do so -- but it's important to keep in mind that the \"Progressives\" are not really a party at all. Their plan is simply to continue tearing down the Democratic Party until they've created a sort of party by default. But to make that happen, they must constantly attack the president's national security-focused agenda and have you believe the president is wrong.\n\nThe truth is, under our current commander in chief, we are all already safer and our country is about to become a lot stronger. It's proof yet again that action speaks a lot louder than words.",

            "body": "The former prime minister can't quite believe the world will keep spinning without his trademark well-timed interventions\n\nPolling day. A day when power reverts temporarily to the people. A day when newspapers send photographers to snap the cutest dogs outside church halls and schools. A day when not much stirs in Westminster.\n\nPolling day. A day when even those not voting catch a lucky break. The rules of purdah apply. So switch on the TV or radio and you'll be spared the sound of politicians talking. Either trying to tell you that everything is working as it should or that it isn't. A day off from the binary reductiveness of political discourse. A chance to reflect on what really matters. Or just to forget.\n\nBut not everywhere was totally silent. Press your ear against the front door of No 10 and you could hear some muffled shouts. Walk inside and you would find the cellar door padlocked. Twice, for good measure. Keir Starmer was determined this particular occupant was not going to be allowed out for a good few days. The prime minister had always been keen on the importance of lessons learned.\n\nBehind the cellar door, sobbing in the dark, sat Tony Blair. Unable to quite believe it had come to this. The lèse-majesté. Tony was used to being heard. When he talked, the world was meant to listen. Only, for the last 24 hours, he had been taken prisoner. Locked in the dark. Heavily medicated.\n\n\"It's for your own good,\" said Pat McFadden. Tony had known he was in deep trouble the moment he had heard the voice of Starmer's enforcer-in-chief. Even the terrifying Morgan McSweeney would have been preferable to The Pat in the Hat. McFadden had only once been known to smile in the years he had been in parliament. And that was when he had been sent out to kneecap a Labour MP for speaking out of turn. Pat had thought he had been doing the man a favour by not waterboarding him. Something Tony would have appreciated. Euphoric recall from his Iraq glory days.\n\nTony was near breaking point. Pleading to be let out. Only yesterday he had been a man of substance. A former prime minister revered by many in the Labour party. Now he had been kidnapped. Spirited away by the heavies in No 10. Regarded by many as just a useful idiot for Reform and the Conservatives.\n\nHow would the world still spin on its axis without yet another very important intervention from him? More importantly, the Gulf states could stop funding his institute if he were suddenly to go quiet on fossil fuels. He had learned long ago never to pay for anything himself. Only mugs did that.\n\n\"It's for your own good,\" yelled enforcer-in-chief Pat McFadden. \"What you've got to learn, old man, is that you're past it. Not just yesterday's man, but the day before yesterday's man. No one is interested in what you have to say any more. You're completely out of your depth. You no longer understand the modern world. You're an embarrassment to the Labour party. Worse, you're an embarrassment to yourself. So we're going to have to put you through a re-education programme.\"\n\nAnything, Tony had mumbled. Anything. Just let him out into the light. Put him back in front of the people.\n\nPat the Hat shook his head. Tony just wasn't getting it. There would be no more media appearances. He would have to take a virtual vow of silence. And anything he did say would have to be personally cleared by him. To make sure he wasn't about to stray off message yet again. Time for another dose of fentanyl. Tony's eyes half closed, his pupils no more than pin-pricks. His voice sedated to a slur. When I said that the government's net zero strategy was doomed to failure without fossil fuels my brain had been captured by Kemi Badenoch and Nigel Farage, Tony stumbled. What I really meant was the complete opposite.\n\n\"Of course you did,\" said Pat the Hat. \"But that's better. A good start. Two more weeks of solitary and we might just be able to let you out under close supervision.\" Tears welled up in Tony's eyes. He wasn't sure he was going to last that long.\n\nThere were also partial signs of life in parliament, where the Commons was going through the motions with business and trade departmental questions. Though there was an odd sense of calm about it all. No one got angry. No one really challenged any of the ministers on anything. It was all a bit like politics used to be before the psychodramas of the last 10 years. When the half-witted became the new normal and we skipped through several news cycles in a single day.\n\nTo listen to the business secretary, Jonathan Reynolds, and his ministerial sidekicks, all was entirely well with the world. Britain had never had it so good. Of course we were going to export more to everyone. The fun times were only minutes away. The desolation of the 14 years of Tory government would soon be just a distant memory. A US trade deal was imminent. And why wouldn't it be, because Agent Orange was clearly a totally rational man. We would get the bigliest, bestest deal ever. Everything was going our way. So much so, there was no need to give parliament a vote on any new treaty because everyone would love it anyway.\n\nAll was also well with the EU. There would be no need for us to align with Europe because Europe would be aligning with us. We would never lower our standards for anyone apart from the countries with whom we needed to lower standards. And so on. The weird thing was that the opposition parties by and large went along with this. There was no fight. No pushback. Just a sense of nothingness. As if nothing really mattered. Perhaps the Tories were just too busy contemplating their probable annihilation in the local elections. No point tempting hubris.\n\nStill, it was all somehow reassuring. The world as we would like it to be. When we can let the politicians do politics without our need to keep a close eye on them. Just a shame it was only for one day. Tomorrow we'll almost certainly find out the world is every bit as perilous as we thought it was.",

            "body": "Years ago, Chief Justice John Roberts joined a decision in favor of Obamacare. Although many believed the ruling defied common sense, Roberts explained that it was not the court's job to correct ballot-box mistakes. That was then. Today we have a different president, elected by a landslide, and a gang of judges stifling his every effort to preside and do his constitutional duty. This behavior flagrantly exceeds their authority, and Chief Justice Roberts seems to see nothing wrong with it.\n\nDouble standards aside, rogue judges are nothing new. A lifetime ago, we had an unwritten rule that juries decided points of fact and judges decided points of law. This meant juries found defendants negligent (or not) and judges ruled on how much, if anything, to award plaintiffs as damages. They couldn't very well add on huge sums for pain and suffering; they'd risk being overruled. Then came an idea: Why not allow juries to decide damage amounts? Since appellate courts seldom overrule juries, the scam prospered. It paved the way for courts to create new currency by fiat, worth no more than Monopoly money, and flood the economy with it. Congress and the Federal Reserve have been unable to stanch the resulting inflation.\n\nThat's one instance. For its part, the Supreme Court has had one or two famously bad chief justices. Given these, we can no longer ignore a gaping hole in the Constitution, hiding in plain sight. It provides no effective procedure for calling rogue or incompetent judges and justices to account. In today's overwrought climate, correcting this will require exceptional leadership and integrity, of the sort never seen before.",

            "title": "Poker Face, Another Simple Favor and Tina Fey's new show: what's new to streaming in Australia in May",
            "body": "Sometimes we don't want high concepts and wow factor; we'll settle for a simple, thoughtfully told story with likeable and well-drawn characters. Going by the first two episodes of Four Seasons, that's definitely the case with this enjoyably staged dramedy (remaking Alan Alda's 1981 film of the same name) centred around three well-off married couples: Kate (Tina Fey) and Jack (Will Forte); Nick (Steve Carell) and Anne (Kenney-Silver); and Danny (Colman Domingo) and Claude (Marco Calvani).\n\nThe primary source of dramatic tension in those early episodes involves Nick planning to divorce Anne, while, at the same time, she's planning a surprise vow renewal ceremony. Awkward.\n\nFilm, USA, 2022 - out 7 May\n\nRobert Eggers has made a career of injecting fusty old narratives - about witches (The Witch), vampires (Nosferatu) and mermaids (The Lighthouse) - with new life and an uncynical appreciation of lore and legend. Taking on the Norse myth that inspired Shakespeare to write Hamlet, The Northman was an attempt, in the writer/director's own words, to make \"the definitive Viking movie\".\n\nThis very trippy and violent revenge story follows Amleth (Alexander Skarsgård), a warrior determined to avenge his father and reclaim his kingdom. It's a stunningly realised work, visceral and lyrical.\n\nFilm, Australia, 2024 - out 16 May\n\nAs I wrote last year: \"Horror movies directed by Indigenous Australians are a largely rare category of cinema, immediately making Jon Bell's Stolen Generations-themed spook-fest The Moogai a work of cultural significance.\" The film is a bumpy ride, far from the allegorical masterpiece many were hoping for, though it's still worth a watch, with plenty to contemplate afterwards. Shari Sebbens leads the cast as Sarah, an Aboriginal lawyer who gives birth to a second child and is haunted by the eponymous monster.\n\nHonourable mentions: Past Lives (film, out now), Cuckoo (film, 8 May), Nonnas (film, 9 May), Bet (TV, 15 May), Love, Death & Robots season 4 (TV, 15 May), Bet season 1 (TV, 15 May), Sirens (TV, 22 May), Fear Street: Prom Queen (film, 23 May), Cold Case: The Tylenol Murders (TV, out 26 May), Aunty Donna's Coffee Café (TV, 30 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 8 May\n\nThe \"howdunit\" is a rare format (most memorably deployed in Columbo) whereby the audience witnesses a crime being committed, then watches the detective put the pieces together. The second season of Poker Face marks the return of Natasha Lyonne's irresistibly sassy Charlie Cale, a former casino employee pursued by murderous goons, who has a supernatural ability to tell when somebody's lying.\n\nThe on-the-run premise enables a steady influx of new characters and settings. Season two begins with a fun story centred around sextuplets (all played by Cynthia Erivo), involving impersonations, inheritance and, of course, good ol' fashioned murder.\n\nHonourable mentions: Jojo Rabbit (film, 4 May), The Walking Dead: Dead City season two (TV, 5 May), Red Rocket (film, 6 May), Titanic (film, 17 May), Gnomeo & Juliet (film, 17 May), Borat (film, 24 May), Borat Subsequent Moviefilm (film, 24 May), Kevin Costner's The West (TV, 28 May), Behind the Candelabra (film, 29 May), Sing Sing (film, 31 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 8 May\n\nThe famous sleuth at 221B Baker Street continues to tossed and turned in the zeitgeist, every generation receiving new variations of Arthur Conan Doyle's iconic character. And it's not just Holmesy who's reinvented but also his colleagues and fam. This year has seen the arrival of the medical drama Watson, following Holmes' longtime assistant, and now a show introducing Amelia (Blu Hunt), a Native American woman who believes that Sherlock (David Thewlis) is her biological father. He's dismissive but, with Watson having disappeared, is in need of an assistant and, well, you know where this is going ...\n\nFilm, Japan, 2017 - out now\n\nThis fiendishly inventive and super-meta Japanese horror flick begins with an audacious, unbroken 37-minute take, capturing what appears to be the production of a low-budget zombie movie that's interrupted by the arrival of actual zombies. Credits roll - and then we get to see what happened before the shoot and what really happened during it. A funny, shrewd, zany film.\n\nHonourable mentions: Gomorrah seasons one to five (TV, out now), Blood Diamond (film, out now), Contact (film, out now), Mars Attacks! (film, out now), Patrick (film, out now), Something's Gotta Give (film, out now), The Black Forest Murders (TV, 8 May), The Eurovision Song Contest 2025 (TV, 14-18 May), The Veil (TV, 27 May).\n\nTV, UK, 2025 - out now\n\nIn my household, the arrival of a new season of this long-running British panel show is a big deal. I've not only exhausted every episode released in recent years but watched many twice. Predicated on guests relaying strange stories that may or may not be true, it's always laugh-out-loud funny, with hilarious, finely honed chemistry between the host, Rob Brydon, and the team captains Lee Mack and David Mitchell.\n\nHonourable mentions: Bergerac season one (TV, 4 May), Return to Belsen (film, 5 May), The Kimberley (TV, 13 May), Gruen season 17 (TV, 14 May), The Imaginarium of Doctor Parnassus (film, 18 May), Picasso season one (TV, 26 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 22 May\n\nThe first season of Nine Perfect Strangers played like Agatha Christie at a wellness resort, following a group of strangers carefully selected by Nicole Kidman's Masha - a mysterious Russian guru with cult leader vibes. Her methods are a mite unconventional, including secretly feeding her guests psychedelic substances.\n\nI found the whole thing deliciously entertaining and moreish, so I'm looking forward to the second season, which is based in the Austrian Alps. The official synopsis promises that nine new suckers, er, strangers, will be \"connected in ways they could never imagine\" by old mate Masha, who'll \"try anything in the interest of healing everyone involved, including herself\".\n\nFilm, USA, 2025 - out now\n\nAnna Kendrick and Blake Lively shared memorable chemistry as young mums and frenemies in Paul Weig's twisty, spritzy neo-noir A Simple Favor, which centres around the mysterious disappearance of Lively's charismatic and flighty Emily.\n\nThe plot of the sequel has Kendrick's Stephanie (now a true crime author) and Emily (freshly released from prison) visiting the island of Capri, Italy, where murder and mayhem ensue. It reportedly delivers more absurd twists. While the Guardian's Adrian Horton says it \"does not match the intoxicating magic of the original\" she also calls it \"confidently ridiculous\" and \"stylishly absurd\".\n\nHonourable mentions: Misery (film, out now), Teen Wolf 1 and 2 (film, out now), The Birdcage (film, out now), Mad Max: Fury Road (film, 6 May), Octopus! (film, 8 May), Kraven the Hunter (film, 12 May), Overcompensating (TV, 15 May), Motorheads (TV, 20 May), Edge of Tomorrow (film, 20 May), Once Upon a Time in Hollywood (film, 27 May), The Better Sister (TV, 29 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 16 May\n\nFans of Lost may be pleased to know that Duster reunites its co-creator JJ Abrams and star Josh Holloway. Pegged as \"a throwback to classic 70s crime shows\", the series is set in the south-west of the US in 1971 and follows the FBI's first female Black agent (Rachel Hilsin) as she teams up with a getaway driver (Holloway) to combat a crime syndicate. The trailer features funkalicious clothes, skidding wheels and jivey tunes.\n\nHonourable mentions: The Conjuring: The Devil Made Me Do It (film, 3 May), Jay & Pamela (TV, 6 May), Pee-Wee as Himself (TV, 24 May), Rick and Morty season eight (TV, 26 May), And Just Like That ... season three (TV, 30 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 29 May\n\nRemember that period in your life when you were kind of OK with sharing a toothbrush with a friend? Adults, which was formerly titled Snowflakes, is about this time, following a group of twentysomethings in New York who do twentysomething stuff. The show's official synopsis claims it puts \"a slightly heightened twist on the wins, losses and humiliations of starting out in the adult world\".\n\nHonourable mentions: Star Wars: Tales of the Underworld (TV, 4 May), FX's Welcome to Wrexham season 4 (TV, 16 May), Tucci in Italy (TV, 19 May).\n\nTV, USA, 2025 - out 16 May\n\nThe protagonist of this twisted sci-fi series based on Martha Wells' books The Murderbot Diaries is a bizarre creation: a robot (Alexander Skarsgård) that hacks its own firmware, enabling it to disobey instructions and do its own thing. Which sounds liberating but, if people realise this hunk of bolts has true autonomy, it'll almost certainly be destroyed.\n\nMurderbot must, therefore, hide its independence and suck it up, while protecting a group of hippy-ish scientists working on a planet where there are terrible insect-like monsters the size of cargo ships. I'm only two episodes in but, already, I'm pretty sure I've never encountered a character quite like this. Murderbot's personality is brought to life through excessively whiny voiceover narration, dropping a tonne of misanthropic lines - like \"Stupid fucking humans!\" and \"These people, honestly!\"\n\nFilm, USA, 2024 - out 16 May\n\nThe director of An Inconvenient Truth, Davis Guggenheim, teams up with deaf actor and activist Nyle DiMarco for this documentary about a week of protests held at Gallaudet University - the world's only deaf university - 1988. They were triggered by four students responding to the university board's decision to select a hearing president, which the school had done for 124 years. The Hollywood Reporter calls it \"a fine entry\" in the \"birth of a movement\" genre, and Variety a \"propulsive nonfiction story\" that \"feels as inspirational as any scripted feature\".\n\nHonourable mentions: Long Way Home (TV, 9 May), Fountain of Youth (film, 23 May), Bono: Stories of Surrender (film, 30 May).\n\nFilm, Australia, 2025 - out 30 May\n\nI doubt anybody was champing at the bit for the cinematic return of Johnny \"Spit\" Spitieri, the criminal and former heroin addict hilariously played by David Wenham in the 2003 Australian film Gettin' Square. But, gawd luv 'im, it's good to see the dodgy bugger back on screens in his very own spin-off feature.\n\nIt's not an amazing movie but, as I wrote in my review, it's enjoyably low-key and occasionally laugh-out-loud funny, the plot revolving around Spitieri being arrested after trying to return to Australia. Goons want him gone forever; cops want his assistance; Spit just wants to do his own thing.\n\nHonourable mentions: The Trouble With Harry (film, 1 May), Beaches (film, 1 May), Ghost Cat Anzu (film, 5 May), Strife season two (TV, 8 May), Kraven the Hunter (film, 12 May), Saturday Night (film, 29 May).",

            "title": "Is the UK's energy storage growing fast enough?",
            "body": "Britain's booming green energy generation has a costly side-effect: the national electricity system operator has had to compensate wind turbine operators that could have produced more clean electricity than the grid could take.\n\nThe cost of paying windfarms to temporarily switch off rose significantly in early 2025, surpassing £250 million in the first two months of the year. This figure not only includes these \"constraint payments\" to windfarm operators, but also payments to gas power plants to switch on and meet demand in the south of England that could theoretically be met by wind energy.\n\nWind power is often generated in remote areas like the Scottish Highlands, where there is low electricity demand. To transmit this power over long distances to areas of higher demand (mostly in the south of England) requires power lines, but these have transmission limits and there are not enough of them.\n\nBritain will only make effective use of its energy potential if grid-scale energy storage keeps pace with the expansion of new windfarms and other forms of intermittent renewable energy, such as solar.\n\nLarge-scale battery systems, pumped hydro and other storage methods could capture the excess energy injected by windfarms on windy days and release it when needed. But are these energy storage options arriving quickly enough?\n\nWhy is storage so important?\n\nMost British consumers will not see a significant change in how they use electricity with the introduction of planned storage installations, other than fewer blips in power quality, such as flickering or dimming lights.\n\nYou might spot these new energy storage facilities in rows of what look like shipping containers but are actually batteries. And the national grid (which serves England, Wales and Scotland - Northern Ireland has a separate electricity network) will be more capable of responding quickly to even minor variations in electricity supply and demand, meaning fewer headlines about curtailed windfarms.\n\nThe UK government is aiming to build up to 27 gigawatts of battery storage by 2030 (in 2023, battery capacity was estimated to be around 5 gigawatts). There are applications totalling 59 gigawatts of battery storage in the connections queue for 2030.\n\nSome of these are speculative - introduced to secure connection slots and permissions, with the intention of selling the rights on. These connections will not necessarily be built, yet contribute to long delays in approvals.\n\nAs a result, the energy regulator Ofgem has been working with network operators to reform the connections queue. This includes new rules and more coordination between grid operators and project developers, as well as incentives (such as lower connection charges) to encourage battery developers to ensure their output can be adjusted to accommodate network constraints when necessary.\n\nHaving substantial grid-scale energy storage could help stabilise electricity prices, which might give households lower and less volatile bills. It would also reduce the need to fire up gas generators during supply lulls, lowering the influence of expensive imported gas on electricity prices.\n\nOptions and opportunities\n\nStoring excess renewable energy involves a range of technologies. Short-duration storage options such as batteries can supply energy ranging from seconds to a few hours. Long-duration storage, such as pumped hydro, can supply energy for several hours, days or more.\n\nPumped hydro is the oldest long-duration storage technology. It involves storing vast amounts of energy by pumping water to a higher reservoir when electricity is plentiful, and releasing it to a lower reservoir through a turbine when needed. Dinorwig in north Wales and Cruachan in western Scotland are capable of storing 9 and 7 gigawatt-hours of energy, respectively.\n\nMajor expansions are planned, such as the new pumped hydro storage scheme Coire Glas in Scotland. Expected to be completed around 2030-31, it is designed to store 30 gigawatt-hours, adding vast reserves of energy to the grid.\n\nBritain's largest grid-scale battery installation, the Minety battery storage project completed in 2022 in Wiltshire, southern England, is capable of absorbing or delivering 150 megawatts - roughly equivalent to the power demand of 450,000 UK households.\n\nWhile Britain is making progress with its storage infrastructure, other countries are scaling up rapidly. China has built huge pumped hydro stations and the US is deploying very large grid-scale batteries. Germany, meanwhile, is testing hydrogen storage to absorb the power from its onshore windfarms.\n\nNew forms of storage\n\nThere is a drive by energy companies to develop new forms of long-duration storage. Along with hydrogen, liquid‑air storage is capable of inter-seasonal storage. This would allow solar energy collected during the summer to be available for release during the duller autumn and winter months.\n\nIn liquid-air plants, excess electricity is used to cool air to a liquid which can then be stored in insulated tanks. When electricity is required, the liquid air is heated and turned back into a gas, which moves a turbine and generates electricity. A 50-megawatt liquid-air plant planned near Manchester is expected to start commercial operation in 2026.\n\nIn hydrogen energy storage plants, surplus electricity powers an electrolyser that splits water molecules into hydrogen and oxygen. The hydrogen is stored and, when electricity is needed, fed into a fuel cell or turbine to generate the electricity. An example is the proposed Aldbrough facility in east Yorkshire, which is expected to be in operation by 2030 and will have a storage capacity of 320 gigawatt-hours. This facility will use three repurposed salt caverns originally developed to store natural gas.\n\nEnergy storage technology has become a serious business opportunity, with companies investing billions of pounds into building new facilities. The variety of projects in the pipeline suggests the UK will be better able to avoid curtailing wind energy in the future, even accounting for growth in wind power capacity. Paying windfarm operators to switch off may soon be a thing of the past.\n\nDon't have time to read about climate change as much as you'd like?\n\nGet a weekly roundup in your inbox instead.
