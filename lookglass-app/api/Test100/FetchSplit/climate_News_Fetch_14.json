            "title": "Freedom in an age of climate crisis and trade wars: Lessons from philosopher Immanuel Kant",
            "body": "A decade ago, the majority of nations committed to the United Nations' Sustainable Development Goals, pledging to \"leave no one behind\" by 2030 and reach net-zero emissions globally by 2050.\n\nTen years on, the sentiment regarding such aspirations is skeptical and the mood gloomy. With the rise of autocracies and the influence of libertarian tech-billionaires on politics, goals such as development for all and climate neutrality seem to be relics of the past.\n\nThe United States, the most powerful country in the world, is at the heart of this shift. In 1776, the U.S. declared independence and was founded on the pursuit of life, liberty and happiness. Today, however, it is increasingly known for its disregard of life, legislative attacks on civil liberties and creating global insecurity through tariffs.\n\nIn the midst of all this, it's important to remember ours is not the first generation to face dark times. As my recent research argues, Immanuel Kant's philosophy can offer us valuable tools for navigating today's challenges.\n\nKant's vision of possible progress\n\nIn 1776, the same year the U.S. was founded, Kant was preparing his breakthrough critical philosophy and lecturing on freedom and pragmatic anthropology, all while living in the absolutist monarchy of Prussia.\n\nAt the time, Prussia was using its military to expand its territory and enforce internal colonization over land and peoples.\n\nAmid this, Kant observed the contradictions of human nature -- people who acted both good and bad, cruel and respectful of others -- and described humanity as \"crooked timber.\" Yet Kant insisted on viewing this \"crooked timber\" through the lens of freedom.\n\nAt the centre of Kant's universalist, freedom-focused vision for the future was the idea of a world where all people lived in dignity. It is focused on autonomy as the capacity to self-legislate. Freedom served as his North Star for what is today called \"backcasting,\" or thinking backward from a desired future to identify possible paths toward achieving it.\n\nRead more: Explainer: the ideas of Kant\n\nIn this spirit, Kant observed the rise of competitive markets that rewarded selfishness and greed, and argued that law and international co-operation -- what he called a federation of republics -- could turn antagonism into springs of progress. In other words, he analyzed the discord and conflict of his present for signs of possible progress.\n\nCrucial for the identification of such possibilities was the freedom of public reason: people thinking for themselves and contributing to public debate.\n\nThinking long-term about freedom\n\nWhat can we learn from Kant about navigating today's multiple crises?\n\nFirst, focus on freedom from a long-term perspective. The current trade war will likely reduce economic growth, but they may also advance the re-regionalization of economies -- an idea long supported by post-growth economists seeking sustainable prosperity.\n\nHowever, regional production is not inherently good. Rather, we need a public discussion about which essential goods -- food, for example -- are best mostly supplied regionally, by whom and where international co-operation is called for.\n\nThe climate crisis requires plans not fixes\n\nSecond, Kant's insights remind us that freedom must be pursued within the reality of a shared, finite planet. Climate change is not a problem that can be solved overnight. Emissions don't care about the threats and angry fits of autocrats. It's a global, complex challenge that requires long-term planning processes.\n\nThere are signs of progress in this regard: in 2024, the United Kingdom reported greenhouse gas emissions to be at their lowest levels since 1872 thanks to long-term planning. Canada, after opting out of the Kyoto Protocol in 2011, finally saw emissions start to fall in 2025 following a renewed commitment to international climate goals and planning.\n\nBut this progress is fragile. The chaos of Trump's tariff wars must not lead our politicians and policymakers to prioritize short-term economic and political gains over long-term climate strategies.\n\nPrime Minister Mark Carney and Conservative Leader Pierre Poilievre's support for pipelines, for instance, is at odds with evidence that fossil fuel expansion will lock in emissions.\n\nIt also diverts public money away from cheaper sources of renewable energy and supporting citizens through a just energy transition. With trade wars and economic insecurity, inflation will likely increase costs of living. This will hit poorer households harder, making this a matter of both environmental and social justice.\n\nRebuilding the public sphere\n\nThird, for Kant, current lifestyle expectations are no guide for the core of future freedom. So if the American treasury secretary asserts that \"cheap goods are not part of the American dream,\" can we, paradoxically, detect an unexpected sign of possible progress?\n\nThe answer is yes -- if we take that example as evidence that worthwhile aspirations cannot be captured by consumerism but call for a more sustained effort.\n\nWhile modern consumers are willing to make big efforts -- such as for daily gym and running routines -- can similar energy be released to collective dreams of progress and saving the planet? For Kant, future freedom requires seeing beyond individual to collective aspirations. This relies on shared goals that can be articulated through foresight and supported by a vibrant, critical public sphere.\n\nIn Kant's time, the public sphere mainly consisted of the Republic of Letters, a network made of intellectuals and writers in the late 17th and 18th centuries engaging in open debate.\n\nToday, by contrast, much of our communication takes place on social media platforms that prioritize short-form formats, reward anger over analysis and are owned by a few global corporations structured to maximize profits rather than the quality of public deliberation. To counter this trend, regionally diverse, independent news providers are needed along with decentralized, open source social media.\n\nBut above all, in an era of climate crisis, political polarization and economic instability, Kant reminds us of what he called a \"Denkungsart:\" an \"art of thinking\" or mindset based on freedom and possibility in a long-term perspective.",

Those moves were advanced enough that the board chose a single head hunting firm for the search.\n\nMr Musk, who owns 13 per cent of Tesla, appeared to get the message, telling investors that \"Starting next month, I'll be allocating far more of my time to Tesla\".\n\nThe threat to remove Mr Musk now appears to have dissipated.\n\nTesla, Musk deny reports\n\nBoth Tesla and its CEO have hit back at the reports.\n\n\"It is an extremely bad breach of ethics that the WSJ would publish a deliberately false article and fail to include an unequivocal denial beforehand by the Tesla board of directors!\" wrote Mr Musk on X.\n\nTesla board chair Robyn Denholm also chimed in.\n\n\"Earlier today, there was a media report erroneously claiming that the Tesla Board had contacted recruitment firms to initiate a CEO search at the company,\" he stated.\n\n\"This is absolutely false (and this was communicated to the media before the report was published).\n\n\"The CEO of Tesla is Elon Musk and the Board is highly confident in his ability to continue executing on the exciting growth plan ahead.\"\n\n\"Tesla was given the opportunity to provide a statement before publication, which they did not do.\"\n\nOriginally published as 'Better off': Claims Tesla looked to replace Elon Musk",

She is the bookies' short-priced favourite at $1.03.\n\nFirst elected in 2013, Ms Price has spent 12 years in Federal politics, serving both in Government and in Opposition during that time.\n\nThroughout that time, she has held ministerial portfolios, including the environment, defence industry, and science and technology at different times.\n\nLabor's Karen Wheatland is the main candidate in Ms Price's way, as she looks to make an impression on the region as her father Ian did.\n\nMs Wheatland said her father had been an inspiration, she and was hoping to do him proud throughout the campaign.\n\nThe late Mr Wheatland was a real estate agent and property developer who helped shape Geraldton.\n\nShe said she considered herself an underdog, but you could \"never say never\".\n\nOther parties have also made their presence known, with Nationals candidate Bailey Kempton and Greens candidate Brendan Sturcke seen in Geraldton in a bid to win votes.\n\nMr Kempton, who runs a local electrician business, hoped the momentum created from the strong Nationals result in regional WA would help his campaign.\n\nMr Sturcke, who is Perth-based, travelled to the electorate for the campaign, and has made his way further north to reach more people and have discussions about climate change.\n\nThe other candidates who have put their hand up for the Durack seat are Kat Wright (Legalise Cannabis), Mark Berry (One Nation), Jason Hunter (Indigenous - Aboriginal Party of Australia), Maarten Kornaat (Trumpet of Patriots), and Eugenie Harris (Australian Christians).\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

All the polls say Labor is almost certain to retain Government, it will just be a matter of whether they cling on to majority, or fall short - and if so, by how much.\n\nGoing into the election, Labor holds a notional 78 seats, the Coalition 57, the Greens 4, and the crossbench 11. The major parties need 76 of the 150 seats to form majority Government, but could govern with 75 by making a crossbencher the speaker.\n\nA handful of marginal seats could swap hands, while there are serious challenges to electorates with more sizeable buffers. The teal wave that swept through capital cities in 2022 could extend into the regions this time, while the Greens face tough competition in their three Queensland seats, and One Nation's vote is up across tehc ountry.\n\nPsephologist Kevin Bonham told The Nightly said there were about 50 seats to pay close attention to - including most marginal seats on either side.\n\n\"If the polls are right, the median result is Labor slightly increasing its majority. There could reasonably be anything from Labor falls into minority by a few through to something lopsided - anything within that range,\" he said.\n\n\"For Labor to fall deeply into minority, something would be deeply wrong... But you can't be absolutely sure until you see what happens.\"\n\nFeel like giving the politicians a rating this Federal election?\n\nOur Pollie Rater lets you do just that.\n\nRate the politicians\n\nLiberal sources know there's a reality where they only win five or six seats come Saturday but are still hopeful a significant Labor backlash eventuates in the outer urban electorates.\n\nLabor MPs and staffers alike are still nervous, but Prime Minister Anthony Albanese is hopeful he doesn't just hold his majority, but increases it.\n\n\"We're aiming to hold every single one of them, and we're out there campaigning hard in Coalition-held seats and in Greens-held seats as well,\" he said on Wednesday.\n\nPollsters, strategists and party sources alike say there are very few guarantees in this election -- Saturday will essentially be \"150 byelections\" but these are about 40 of the key ones to watch.\n\nVictoria\n\nOf the state's 38 seats, a handful could change hands on Saturday night. The unpopular state Government has been a drag on federal Labor's vote, but they're hopeful the outer-suburban wipeout the Coalition had been hoping for doesn't eventuate.\n\nThe Liberals have made no secret of their aspiration to pinch Chisholm back from the Labor Party, while Aston -- which was won by the Government in the 2023 byelection on a fluke -- will inevitably change hands. \"We're not supposed to have it,\" one Labor source said.\n\nMcEwan, in the city's north, is held by Labor with 3.8 per cent. Dutton has now visited the seat three times this campaign and is firming up to be one of Labor's losses. Dunkley, in the city's east is another one of those outer-metropolitan/ peri urban seats where the cost-of-living factor could go against Labor's 6.8 per cent margin.\n\nThe safe Labor seat of Gorton, held with 10 per cent, became the centre of a concerted Coalition advertising campaign mid-way through the campaign. Labor could suffer a significant swing here, but party insiders believe it will hold. They share the same view about Hawke (7.6 per cent), which Mr Dutton has now visited twice in five weeks to Mr Albanese's zero.\n\nMeanwhile in Bendigo, the Nationals are in with a strong chance of decimating Labor's 11.2 per cent margin to add it to its column.\n\nLabor is also fighting on its left flank, with the Greens running strong races in Wills and Macnamarra -- where preference flows will be crucial. The minor party are most confident about knocking Wills MP Peter Khalil off.\n\nLabor could recover some of their losses by picking up Deakin, which is held by the Liberals on 0.02 per cent.\n\nLiberal sources believe they will pick up either Goldstein or Kooyong from the teal independents. Former MP Tim Wilson is running a strong campaign in the former, and Mr Dutton spent time with candidate Amelia Hammer in Kooyong this week to throw his support behind her.\n\nBut the Coalition could lose Dan Tehan's regional seat of Wannon to Climate-200 backed candidate Alex Dyson.\n\nNSW\n\nThe Coalition is most confident of its chances in picking up the Labor-held seat of Gilmore, where former state MP Andrew Constance is again taking on Fiona Phillips' wafer thin 0.2 per cent margin.\n\nIn Sydney, the redistribution has reverted Labor-held Bennelong - the seat of former PM John Howard - back to the Liberals. Mr Albanese visited the electorate on Monday to hand out how-to-vote cards with incumbent MP Jerome Laxale, and Labor sources acknowledge the seat will be a tough fight - but are hopeful it will hold.\n\nThe Liberals have made some noise about Labor-held Reid, Parramatta, and Werriwa. Werriwa appears the most likely to change hands, if the outer-suburban swing away from Labor manifests, and dependent on how the third-party vote pans out.\n\nOut in the city's west, Labor is pouring resources into Fowler, where independent Dai Le won by 1.1 per cent in 2022 following a disastrous decision by Labor to parachute in senator Kristina Kenneally. This time, they've backed in Tu Le, and Mr Albanese received a warm reception during a streetwalk earlier this week.\n\nBoth Mr Dutton and Mr Albanese stopped in the country's bellwether seat of Robertson on the same day this week. Both parties say they are confident in this central coast seat - but whatever happens here has for 15 elections been a reflection of the national mood.\n\nBradfield, which has been a blue-ribbon seat since its creation in 1972, has captured some of the independent voters from the abolished electorate of North Sydney, and the Liberal's margin has been reduced to a narrow 2.5 per cent. With Paul Fletcher retiring, there's a strong belief well-financed independent Nicolette Boele could win the seat on her second tilt.\n\nOf the other blue-ribbon seats that went teal in 2022, Mackellar - held by Sophie Scamps - is discussed as the most likely to revert.\n\nIn the regions, Calare will make for a fascinating watch where a three-way competition between the Nationals, party defector and incumbent Andrew Gee, and a Climate-200 backed independent.\n\nIn Cowper, where independent Caz Jeise shaved off almost 10 per cent of Nationals MP Pat Conaghan's margin in 2022, Coalition sources acknowledge they face a serious threat.\n\nQueensland\n\nThe Sunshine State offers Labor the most chances for gains. Greens-held Brisbane will be a three-way contest, and it could go to either Labor or the Liberal Party, depending on preferences. If Labor's Madonna Jarrett can finish second ahead of incumbent Stephen Bates, she can clinch the seat on preferences.\n\nThe Coalition feels more confident in wresting Ryan back from the Greens.\n\nGriffith, Kevin Rudd's old seat, will be another fierce contest against Greens' MP Max Chandler-Mather. Mr Albanese visited the seat on Tuesday, and Labor sources acknowledge it will be difficult - less of a sure bet, but possible.\n\nThe bayside seat of Bonner has been in Coalition hands since 2010, but as Labor has improved in national polling this electorate has emerged as a must-watch seat with Mr Albanese visiting the seat on Tuesday. In Leichhardt in the state's north, candidate Matt Smith has had plenty of frontbench support in the last five weeks and a strong advertising campaign behind him.\n\nMr Dutton's seat of Dickson, which he holds with a slim 1.7 per cent margin, could provide a fascinating result. Labor's Ali France is running for a third time, and it was the first stop on Mr Albanese's campaign. The emergence of a Climate 200-backed candidate who hails from a Liberal-supporting part of the electorate has Mr Dutton vulnerable in his own backyard.\n\nClimate-200 independents are running strong in the regional electorate of Groom, which has emerged as a dark horse, as well as the Gold Coast seat of McPherson. While the Coalition has buffers of 6.9 per cent and 9.3 per cent respectively, there's an outside chance of some movement.\n\nTasmania\n\nFour of the apple isle's five seats are under the spotlight this election. Labor believe they have a chance of flipping Bass and/ or Braddon, on margins of 1.4 per cent and eight per cent respectively. The Liberals have thrown a lot of resources at taking Lyons from Labor, with Mr Dutton making his fifth visit this campaign on Thursday.\n\nThe safe Labor seat of Franklin, held by minister Julie Collins on 13.7 per cent, is on the wildcard list. Solidly Labor since 1993, the salmon farming issue has become potent in the electorate and independent Peter George, backed by Climate 200, has run a highly visible and well-funded campaign.\n\nWA\n\nLabor is in a good position to hold all nine of its seats in WA, including Tangney. The new electorate of Bullwinkel, which is notionally Labor, is favoured by the Liberals.\n\nThe Liberals are confident the affluent blue-ribbon seat of Curtin, which went teal in 2022, will return to them. But they could lose the regional seat of Forrest, where Climate-200 backed Sue Chapman has run a strong campaign and could pinch the seat from the Liberals after 53 years.\n\nSA\n\nThe suburban seat of Sturt is a three-cornered race, where Liberal MP James Stevens faces a tough battle against Labor and a new independent challenger. The Greens picked up 16 per cent of the vote last time, so any increase to that vote, as well as preference flows from the independent, could put this seat in Labor's hands.\n\nLabor could lose nearby Boothby, where former MP Nicolle Flint is taking on the Labor incumbent. Liberals are confident her name recognition will help them.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

            "body": "2025 Federal election: Durack candidates have their final say ahead of polls on SaturdayMatthew PaddickGeraldton GuardianFri, 2 May 2025 2:00AM\n\nAhead of the 2025 Federal election on Saturday, the Geraldton Guardian reached out to the nine candidates in the Durack electorate so they could deliver their final pitch to voters.\n\nHere's what they had to say on why they deserve your vote, in order of how they appear on the ballot.\n\nMelissa Price (Liberal)\n\nI've had the privilege of representing Durack since 2013. Over the past 12 years, I've worked hard to deliver the infrastructure and services our vast electorate deserves -- better roads, mobile coverage, NBN upgrades, and support for local mining and council projects.\n\nI am proud of the Liberal Party's strong commitment to mental health, including new headspace centres across Durack, which are making a real difference for young people and families.\n\nFeel like giving the politicians a rating this Federal election?\n\nOur Pollie Rater lets you do just that.\n\nRate the politicians\n\nOne of my proudest achievements is helping establish the Pilbara Kimberley University Centre, which is transforming access to regional education and workforce development.\n\nMy team and I have helped thousands of constituents resolve complex issues with Centrelink, the NDIS, veterans services and immigration. We live here, we understand the challenges, and we care deeply about the people we serve.\n\nThis Saturday, I ask for your support to continue delivering for Durack with experience, energy and determination and a Liberal government ready to get Australia back on track.\n\nKat Wright (Legalise Cannabis)\n\nLisa Simpson once said: \"The whole damn system is wrong.\" And let's be honest -- she's right.\n\nIn Durack and across regional Australia, people are doing it tough while the same old systems protect the few and leave the rest of us behind. Whether it's housing, jobs, farming, or climate -- what we have isn't working. It's time for a reset.\n\nThat's why I'm running for the Legalise Cannabis Party -- not just to legalise hemp, but to use it to build something better. Hemp can power real, grassroots reform: affordable housing made from hempcrete, jobs in regional processing, regenerative farming that heals our land, and a circular economy where waste becomes opportunity.\n\nThis isn't a pipedream -- it's a practical, profitable and sustainable path forward that starts right here in Durack.\n\nMartin Luther King Jr warned us against political apathy when he said: \"If you fail to act now, history will have to record that the greatest tragedy of this period of social transition was not the strident clammer of the bad people but the appalling silence of the good people.\"\n\nI won't be silent. I will stand up because our system needs fixing.\n\nTogether we can overGROW the government.\n\nBailey Kempton (Nationals)\n\nDuring the aftermath of cyclone Seroja, I witnessed the neglect that regional people face even during crises. In Durack, we work hard, and we love where we live, but we get only a fraction back of what we contribute to the nation's economy. We're being let down by the Government, and we need a different approach.\n\nWe deserve access to quality health care, education and to travel on well-maintained roads. It's clear that families are struggling with the cost of living and need real action that will help their back pocket now, not in 15 months. By halving fuel excise, we will provide immediate relief to those who need it most.\n\nI decided to run for politics after becoming tired of watching these issues persist without change. The current Government seems unconcerned about the opinions of Australians, especially those outside the city. This is confirmed through recent remarks by a senior Labor member about the Voice being inevitable, despite the referendum result.\n\nMy campaign has been about stepping up, engaging with the community, hearing your concerns and offering a different choice. Durack needs someone with common sense who won't back down in the fight because where we live is worth fighting for.\n\nMark Berry (One Nation)\n\nDurack stands at a crossroads. We can stick with the same failed policies that have made life harder, or we can choose a new path -- one that puts everyday Australians first.\n\nFor too long, both major parties have put ideology ahead of common sense. They've driven up the cost of living, neglected essential services and allowed our freedoms to erode. That must end.\n\nAs your One Nation candidate, I won't make empty promises. I will fight to reduce the tax burden on working Australians and eliminate billions in government waste. I stand for real reform -- not more bureaucracy.\n\nFreedom of speech must be protected. It's a cornerstone of our democracy, and I will work to enshrine it in our Constitution. The major parties won't defend this right -- but I will.\n\nAs a proud Australian Army veteran, I served this country to protect our values. I won't stand by while they're stripped away.\n\nThis election is about reclaiming our voice, restoring our freedoms and building a fairer future for all Australians. With your support and trust, we can lead that change -- together.\n\nJason Hunter (Indigenous -- Aboriginal Party of Australia)\n\nAs a Nykina man, I'm running to finally put First Nations voices at the heart of Durack's future.\n\nFor too long, our communities have been sidelined while politicians treat Indigenous issues as political wedges.\n\nMy first priority is protecting the Martuwarra (Fitzroy River) and all our precious waterways from fracking and over-extraction, respecting 60,000 years of Indigenous water stewardship that major parties continue to ignore.\n\nThe cost-of-living crisis demands more than temporary rebates. I'll fight to break the Coles/Woolworths duopoly through enforced ACCC reforms and invest in regional food security projects to actually lower prices at the checkout. Unlike the majors who protect mining profits, I'll make corporations pay their fair share to fund lasting solutions.\n\nOn housing, I'll push to tax vacant properties, cap investor tax perks, and expand safe caravan park spaces for those struggling to find homes. For health care, we'll clean contaminated water supplies and replace punitive approaches with proper mental health support and preventative care focused on nutrition and healthy living.\n\nDurack deserves an economy beyond mining booms. I'll champion sustainable industries like hemp and renewables, fight to keep rural hospitals open, and create Indigenous-led housing and education programs with real job pathways.\n\nHealing country begins when traditional knowledge guides decision-making. After generations of empty promises, I'll bring that change to Canberra.\n\nMaarten Kornaat (Trumpet of Patriots)\n\nPutting Australians First.\n\nI will fight to ease the cost of living by introducing a 15 per cent iron ore mining levy, with proceeds used to reduce national debt and raise the tax-free income threshold. Education must be a right, not a burden -- university will be free for Australian citizens, and all HECS debts will be forgiven.\n\nGovernment waste will be addressed through a full audit, with spending redirected to benefit Australian citizens and interests.\n\nI will fight to restore freedom by reducing government overreach, eliminating red tape, and empowering individuals and small businesses, especially in regional areas. Farmers must be free to farm, and doctors free to heal patients without interference.\n\nA royal commission into the government's COVID-19 response will be launched to identify failings, ensure accountability and learnings will be implemented to protect our rights.\n\nAustralia's sovereignty comes first. I will review all international memberships, including with the WEF (World Economic Forum) and WHO, to ensure they align with national interests. All public-private partnerships will be audited to guarantee they serve the Australian people -- not foreign or corporate agendas.\n\nI will be listening to and addressing the concerns of the people of Durack.\n\nLet's shape the future of Australia together!\n\nKaren Wheatland (Labor)\n\nI'm running because Durack deserves better -- better health care, better jobs and a future our kids can actually afford.\n\nReal change doesn't happen from the sidelines. It happens when you're in the room, helping to make the decisions that matter.\n\nVoting Labor is the best way to get things done -- on cost of living, climate, housing, health care -- all the everyday big stuff.\n\nThe Albanese Labor Government has a real plan to deliver cost-of-living relief, build more things right here, and make housing more accessible.\n\nLabor's already delivering -- from Medicare Urgent Care Clinics to major road upgrades -- and I want to keep Durack moving forward, not backwards under Peter Dutton.\n\nI've lived the life so many in Durack are living right now. I've worked the boats, raised my kids on my own, and fought hard to survive each day.\n\nI know what it's like to be stretched, doing your best, and still turning up. That's the kind of representative I'll be -- someone who shows up, fights smart, and never forgets where they came from.\n\nDurack deserves someone who gets it. I do. And I'm ready to get to work.\n\nBrendan Sturcke (Greens)\n\nDurack is a remarkable electorate, my time as a farmhand and in the mining industry has created deep ties with the area and I'm excited to be able to offer people the opportunity to vote for real change.\n\nWe know farmers and fishers are some of the most affected by the climate crisis and supermarket price gouging, which is why we're pushing for stronger climate action and strengthening protections like making the Food and Grocery Code of Conduct mandatory.\n\nAs I've travelled across the electorate, the overwhelming feedback I've been receiving is people are feeling abandoned by the Government.\n\nWe know local communities have the answers to the problems they're facing, we need to be listening and working with people on the ground to find meaningful solutions.\n\nNow isn't the time to be tinkering around the edges, the majority of people are struggling with housing, cost of living, and health and the Government must act.\n\nThe Greens are the only party taking real action on the climate and cost-of-living crises.\n\nThis election is a pivotal moment in history, not only for the planet but also the people of Durack. Nothing changes if you don't vote for it.\n\nAustralian Christians candidate Eugenie Harris did not respond to the Geraldton Guardian's request for comment.\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",
