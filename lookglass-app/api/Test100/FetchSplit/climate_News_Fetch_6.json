            "body": "Geopolitical Risks: China has weaponized rare earth exports in past trade disputes; rising U.S.-China tensions could disrupt supply chains, crippling AI, drones, and renewable energy sectors.\n\nA new investigative report has exposed a looming crisis for the United States' ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics: China's near-total control over rare earth minerals essential for manufacturing advanced technology. With the U.S. heavily reliant on Chinese exports, experts warn that America's ability to scale up AI-driven robotics -- critical for military, medical, and industrial applications -- is at serious risk.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is neodymium, a rare earth element vital for producing high-performance magnets used in actuators -- the components that enable robotic movement. Without neodymium, the production of advanced robots grinds to a halt.\n\n\"If you don't have neodymium, you can't make actuators. And if you can't make actuators, you can't make robots,\" warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, in a recent analysis. \"Guess who controls the world's neodymium output? China, with a near-monopoly.\"\n\nChina currently dominates over 90% of global rare earth production, including dysprosium and praseodymium, which are also crucial for heat-resistant magnets in robotics and electric vehicles. The U.S., meanwhile, has fallen dangerously behind in domestic extraction and refining capabilities.\n\nRecognizing the vulnerability, the Trump administration recently signed a mineral extraction deal with Ukraine, part of a broader strategy to secure alternative sources of rare earths. Similar negotiations are reportedly underway with African nations.\n\n\"Whoever makes the best robots -- and the most robots -- will dominate wars, economic competition, aerospace, and medicine,\" Adams notes. However, analysts caution that these efforts may be too little, too late. Even with new mining agreements, China's refining infrastructure and supply chain dominance mean breaking free from dependence will take years -- if it's possible at all.\n\nThe stakes extend far beyond robotics. AI development, military drones, medical devices, and even renewable energy technologies like wind turbines rely on these minerals. A supply disruption could cripple multiple industries, leaving the U.S. scrambling for alternatives.\n\nMeanwhile, China has shown a willingness to weaponize its rare earth dominance. In past trade disputes, it has restricted exports to pressure other nations. With tensions rising between Washington and Beijing, the risk of such tactics being used again is high.\n\nThe U.S. must accelerate domestic mining and processing capabilities while forging alliances with mineral-rich nations. But time is running short. As Adams puts it: \"The race for robot supremacy is really a race for rare earth control -- and right now, China is winning.\"\n\nFor now, America's AI and robotics future hinges on a precarious supply chain -- one controlled by its greatest geopolitical rival.\n\nWatch the May 1 episode of \"Brighteon Broadcast News\" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about minerals deals, elemental crisis, Walmart, China and robots...it's all connected.\n\nELEMENTAL CRISIS: How China and Russia Control the Critical Minerals Needed for AI, Military Robots, and Economic Domination\n\nTrump's critical Ukraine minerals deal nears completion",

            "body": "The suits, which legal experts say are unprecedented, mark the latest of the Trump administration's attacks on environmental work and raise concern over states' abilities to retain the power to take climate action without federal opposition.\n\nIn court filings, the justice department said the Clean Air Act - a federal law authorizing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate air emissions - \"creates a comprehensive program for regulating air pollution in the United States and 'displaces' the ability of states to regulate greenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders\".\n\nThe justice department argues that Hawaii and Michigan are violating the intent of the act that enables the EPA authority to set nationwide standards for greenhouse gases, citing the states' pending litigation against oil and gas companies for alleged climate damage.\n\nMichigan's attorney general, Dana Nessel, a Democrat, last year tapped private law firms to go after the fossil fuel industry for negatively affecting the state's climate and environment.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawaii's governor, Josh Green, another Democrat, plans to target fossil fuel companies that he said should take responsibility for their role in the state's climate consequences, including 2023's deadly Lahaina wildfire.\n\nWhen burned, fossil fuels release emissions such as carbon dioxide that warm the planet.\n\nBoth states' laws \"impermissibly regulate out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions and obstruct the Clean Air Act's comprehensive federal-state framework and EPA's regulatory discretion\", the justice department's court filings said.\n\nThe justice department also repeated the Republican president's claims of America's energy emergency and crisis. \"At a time when states should be contributing to a national effort to secure reliable sources of domestic energy\", Hawaii and Michigan are \"choosing to stand in the way\", the filings said.\n\nA spokesperson for the office of the Democratic Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, deferred to Nessel when asked for comment.\n\n\"This lawsuit is at best frivolous and arguably sanctionable,\" Nessel said in a statement, which noted that Michigan hasn't filed a lawsuit. \"If the White House or big oil wish to challenge our claims, they can do so when our lawsuit is filed; they will not succeed in any attempt to preemptively bar our access to make our claims in the courts. I remain undeterred in my intention to file this lawsuit the president and his big oil donors so fear.\"\n\nGreen's office and the Hawaii attorney general's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut legal experts raised concern over the government's arguments.\n\nMichael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said usual procedure is for the justice department to ask for a court to intervene in pending environmental litigation - as is the case in some instances across the country.\n\nWhile this week's suits are consistent with Trump's plans to oppose state actions that interfere with energy dominance, \"it's highly unusual\", Gerrard told the Associated Press. \"What we expected is they would intervene in the pending lawsuits, not to try to preempt or prevent a lawsuit from being filed. It's an aggressive move in support of the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\"It raises all kinds of eyebrows,\" he added. \"It's an intimidation tactic, and it's telling the fossil fuel companies how much Trump loves them.\"\n\nAnn Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has previously consulted on climate litigation, said this week's lawsuits look \"like DoJ grasping at straws\", noting that the EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, said his agency is seeking to overturn a finding under the Clean Air Act that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.\n\n\"So on the one hand the US is saying Michigan, and other states, can't regulate greenhouse gases because the Clean Air Act does so and therefore preempts states from regulating,\" Carlson said. \"On the other hand the US is trying to say that the Clean Air Act should not be used to regulate. The hypocrisy is pretty stunning.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has aggressively targeted climate policy in the name of fossil fuel investment. Federal agencies have announced plans to bolster coal power, roll back landmark water and air regulations, block renewable energy sources, and double down on oil and gas expansion.",

            "title": "Have The Intermittent Energy Blackouts Begun?",
            "body": "Today there have been widespread electricity blackouts across Europe, beginning in Spain and Portugal in the early afternoon (local time), and then spreading to other countries including France, Andorra, Belgium and the Netherlands. Is this related to the increasing penetration of intermittent generation from wind and solar facilities?\n\nFor years, many in the climate skeptic community have warned that expansion of intermittent renewable electricity generation on the grid will, sooner or later, lead to frequent blackouts. The reason for the warning is easy to understand: The grid has some rather exacting operational requirements that the intermittent renewable generation technologies cannot fulfill. Primary among these requirements are, first, minute-by-minute matching of electricity supply with electricity demand and, second, grid-wide synchronization of the frequency of the alternating current. When wind and solar provided relatively small portions of the electricity consumed, other generation sources, particularly thermal (fossil fuel) and hydro, would fulfill these requirements. But as wind and solar come to dominate generation, the problems become much more difficult to solve.\n\nHere at Manhattan Contrarian, I have mostly steered clear of covering this topic. Although I think I understand the main issues, I am certainly not a grid engineer. And there are many smart people who are engineers and who have the job of \"balancing\" the grid to keep it consistently up and running in the face of the challenges of intermittent wind and solar generation. Maybe they can succeed. I doubt it. But I definitely have wanted to avoid \"crying wolf,\" predicting over and over that frequent blackouts are imminent, only to find that the engineers have come up with solutions that seem to work reasonably well.\n\nAs of this writing, it does not appear that a definitive cause (or causes) of today's blackouts has been established. However, there is every reason to think that the increasing penetration of wind and solar generation in Spain is the most important part of the problem. Here are links to some articles that have appeared so far today: this one from the Daily Mail at 8:41 AM EDT (which would be 2:41 PM in Spain); this one from Yahoo News at 10:21 AM EDT (4:21 PM in Spain); and this one from Climate Change Dispatch (no time indicated, but based on a paywalled piece from the Telegraph, with a time stamp of 3:21 BST).\n\nAccording to the piece in the Daily Mail, Spain's state electricity network operator, known as Red Electric, reported that today's problem began with \"'a very strong oscillation' in the electrical network [that] caused Spain's power system to 'disconnect from the European system.'\" On the question of the initial cause of the \"oscillation,\" there is only speculation. Proposed causes range from \"extreme temperature variations along very high-voltage power lines in Spain,\" to a hacking attack.\n\nBut whatever the initial cause of the \"oscillation,\" what is clear is that the Spanish system then lacked the ability to respond sufficiently to keep the power on. Why? The Daily Mail puts forth a very plausible explanation of grid instability resulting from heavy reliance on wind and solar generation. The Mail attributes the theory to \"some analysts\" (unnamed):\n\n[S]ome analysts have suggested that the Spanish grid operator's reliance on renewable energy sources to supply the majority of the nation's electricity could have led to the blackout. Traditional generators, like coal and hydroelectric plants or gas turbines, are connected directly to the grid via heavy spinning machines. When turned on, these massive machines are in constant motion and the inertia created by their weight and momentum acts like a shock absorber, helping to insulate the grid against a sudden disturbance - for example, in the event of a transmission failure. Solar and wind power do not provide the natural inertia generated by these so-called 'spinning machines', leaving the grid more vulnerable to disruptions and subsequent oscillations in the electrical frequency.\n\nJust before the blackout hit, it seems that solar facilities were generating over 60% of Spain's electricity:\n\nAt 12:30pm local time today - five minutes before the widespread blackouts occurred - solar power was generating some 60% of Spain's electricity. . . .\n\nBut how about wind generation? This is from the Yahoo News piece:\n\nSpain has one of Europe's highest proportions of renewable energy, providing about 56pc of the nation's electricity. More than half of its renewables comes from wind with the rest from solar and other sources. That means Spain's electricity supplies are increasingly reliant on the weather delivering enough wind to balance its grid. For much of the last 24 hours, that wind has been largely missing. The website Windy.com, for example, shows wind speeds of 2-3mph, leaving the country reliant on solar energy and old gas-fired power stations.\n\nSo when the \"oscillation\" occurred, what is going to keep the grid steady on its 50 Hz frequency? From Michael Schellenberger today on X:\n\n[A]ll of Europe appears to have been seconds away a continent-wide blackout. The grid frequency across continental Europe plunged to 49.85 hertz -- just a hair above the red-line collapse threshold. The normal operating frequency for Europe's power grid is 50.00 Hz, kept with an extremely tight margin of ±0.1 Hz. Anything outside ±0.2 Hz triggers major emergency actions. If the frequency had fallen just another 0.3 Hz -- below 49.5 Hz -- Europe could have suffered a system-wide cascading blackout.\n\nThe bottom line is that there were multi-hour blackouts in many places today. A random \"oscillation\" of some sort, which could have been easily handled in a world of fossil fuel power plants, became a huge problem when wind and solar generators could not respond to it appropriately. And so people were stuck for hours in elevators or subway trains; traffic lights went dark; banking and cell phone networks stopped working; and so forth. But within a few hours all of those were back in business.\n\nSo was this really a big deal? As Schellenberger points out, with just \"a hair\" more frequency variation it could have been far worse. Will that happen some time soon? I'm not going to pretend I know. But I do know that the electricity system in most of Europe and many U.S. states is in the hands of crazed fanatics who have no idea what they are doing. My own bet would be that there are many far worse blackouts to come, until this idiotic \"net zero\" thing is abandoned.",

            "body": "China has not taken over a disputed islet near a key Philippines island despite a provocative Chinese coast guard operation last month to plant a flag on the reef, the State Department said.\n\nChinese state media announced recently that its coast guard in mid-April carried out a \"maritime control\" activity over what Beijing calls Tiexian Reef and the Philippines calls Sandy Cay.\n\nReports showed a group of camouflaged Chinese troops holding a flag there in a bid to assert sovereignty over the small islet in the Spratly Islands.\n\nDays after the photo of the Chinese flag was published, troops from the Philippine coast guard, navy and police landed on the 180-square-yard reef and were photographed holding a Philippines flag on April 25.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chinese warships were dispatched to the area amid official charges by Beijing that the Philippines is engaged in \"disturbances.\"\n\nThe Philippines military said in a statement, also on Tuesday, that U.S. and Philippines air forces carried out a joint patrol over the South China Sea to highlight joint defense cooperation. The air patrol included three Philippines FA-50 fighter jets, two U.S. B-1B bombers, two F-16s and an F-18.\n\nA State Department official denied the islet was overrun by China.\n\n\"China's provocative flag unfurling is detrimental to preserving peace and stability in the region and is the latest example of its repeated escalatory and irresponsible actions in the South China Sea,\" the official told The Washington Times.\n\n\"Contrary to media reports, China has not 'seized' Sandy Cay and the feature remains unoccupied,\" the official said.\n\nWashington remains in close communications with Philippines officials regarding the attempt to assert Chinese sovereignty, the official said.\n\nThe dual flag-planting and claims over the reef are the latest round in mounting tensions between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea.\n\nSandy Cay is less than three miles from the Philippines island of Pagasa that hosts military forces and a civilian population.\n\nPegasa, also called Thitu Island, is the location of a Japanese-built radar system and is used for training by the Philippine navy's special warfare group.\n\nThe island also has a coast guard base that was set up in 2023 to counter what Manila called Chinese aggression in the region.\n\nChina claims 90% of the South China Sea, including the Spratlys, which are near the main Philippines island of Luzon.\n\nChina's South China Sea sovereignty claim was struck down as illegal by an international arbitral tribunal in 2016, although China rejected the ruling and has continued provocative actions in a bid to assert control over the South China Sea.\n\nThe sea is a major strategic waterway that sees between an estimated $3.5 trillion and $5 trillion annually in trade.\n\nChina's military has seized a number of disputed islands since 2012 and built military bases on several that are now armed with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nChina and the Philippines recently have engaged in a series of low-level confrontations in the region involving the ramming of vessels, the firing of water cannon by Chinese ships and, in at least two cases, China's use of lasers against Philippines aircraft and vessels.\n\nThe State Department has declared several times in recent years that any Chinese attack on the Philippines over disputed islands could trigger the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty.\n\nHowever, Navy forces have taken no action to intervene in the sea confrontations.\n\nChina's state CCTV broadcaster said the landing on Sandy Cay was designed to \"exercise sovereignty and jurisdiction,\" to carry out an \"inspection,\" and \"collect video evidence regarding the illegal activities of the Philippine side.\"\n\nThe People's Liberation Army said Tuesday that the southern theater command dispatched warships in the South China Sea on routine patrols.\n\n\"Recently, the Philippines has been frequently carrying out maritime infringement provocations, creating disturbances and pulling in countries from outside the region to organize so-called 'joint patrols,'\" it said.\n\n\"Troops in the theater of operations are maintaining a high level of alert, resolutely defending the country's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and resolutely safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea region.\"\n\nThe Chinese sovereignty claim over Sandy Cay has raised concerns among U.S. and Philippines officials that the operation there will signal a new expansion of the Chinese military's island reclamation project.\n\nIn 2012, China took over Scarborough Shoal in the Spratlys and the Obama administration took no action against the takeover.\n\nThe lack of a response set in motion a major Chinese island-building campaign that resulted in new PLA bases on several reefs, including Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef and Subi Reef.\n\nRetired Navy Capt. Jim Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence director, said the latest attempted island grab by China is \"another step in the continuation of the [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party's Great Rejuvenation strategy to 'restore' territory they falsely assert is theirs.\"\n\n\"The world has witnessed, since 2012 at Scarborough Shoal, the People's Republic of China take physical possession and control of the vast majority of the South China Sea,\" he said in an email.\n\nCapt. Fanell said more than a decade of \"doing nothing\" against the Chinese maritime sovereignty campaign demonstrates that U.S. resolve has eroded and that American national security and naval forces in the Pacific are at great risk, as well as those of U.S. allies.\n\nHe urged the Trump administration to counter the Chinese maritime aggression by dispatching Navy warships to the sea. \"It is long past time to dispatch the Seventh Fleet to these waters to prevent or disrupt any PRC effort to seize another inch of territory from our treaty ally,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not a call to war, but a call to stand up and push back.\"\n\nCarl O. Schuster, also a retired Navy captain, said the photo op on Sandy Cay appears to be a variant of China's 1990s tactic of planting \"border\" markers on uninhabited atolls, islets and cays.\n\nThe objective is to create false evidence used to back the Beijing narrative of ownership over the South China Sea.\n\nPhilippines authorities landing on the Cay and photographing their flag seek to counter the Chinese operation.\n\n\"This incident was a test to determine how Manila and Washington would react,\" Capt. Schuster said.\n\n\"Had the Philippines done nothing but protest, the PRC would have initiated the next step -- construction of a 'fishing shelter' for its fishing community operating in the area,\" he said. \"However, Manila's response has interrupted China's narratives and immediate plans.\"\n\nThe current standoff in the South China Sea comes as U.S. military forces are engaged in a major annual exercise with the Philippines known as Balikatan.\n\nThe exercises have included the deployment of long-range U.S. land-attack missiles and a new remotely controlled anti-ship missile system.\n\nThe exercises and the missile deployments were denounced by China as destabilizing.",

The US has a financial commitment of $183 billion to the IMF.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained last week that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are suffering from \"mission creep.\" But Bessent announced that Trump will be \"doubling down\" on supporting the largest foreign aid gushers on earth. \"Far from stepping back, 'America First' seeks to expand U.S. leadership in international institutions like the I.M.F. and World Bank,\" Bessent declared.\n\nBessent complained that the IMF \"devotes disproportionate time and resources to work on climate change, gender, and social issues.\" Unfortunately, Bessent said nothing about how the IMF and World Bank bankrolled many of the worst crony Covid crackdown policies.\n\nBut what should the US government expect when Congress and endless presidents give the World Bank and IMF billions of US tax dollars to play with? The US government is on the hook for $52 billion to the World Bank. The US has a financial commitment of $183 billion to the IMF.\n\nThe IMF was created in 1944 to shore up currencies and help nations with temporary balance-of-payment problems. In the decades since the IMF's founding, global capital markets and fluctuating currency exchange rates have made the IMF a relic. But too many people have gotten rich from IMF largesse to permit the curtain to be closed on this institution.\n\nThe IMF enabled scores of governments that chose to pointlessly shut down their own economies after the outbreak of Covid-19. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva declared in April 2021, \"While the recovery [from Covid] is underway, too many countries are falling behind and economic inequality is worsening. Strong policy action is needed to give everyone a fair shot -- a shot in the arm to end the pandemic everywhere, and a shot at a better future for vulnerable people and countries.\"\n\nThe IMF's \"fair shot\" consisted of its international bureaucrats providing scores of billions of dollars in \"emergency financing\" to 80 governments, most of whom exploited Covid to stretch their own power. The IMF provided emergency relief via the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) to 29 governments to supposedly help them \"combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The IMF's deluge of handouts to government helped fuel the worldwide inflation surge in recent years.\n\nThe World Bank President Ajay Banga \"has sought to emphasize the bank's focus on job creation...and to prioritize private sector involvement in projects around the world,\" the New York Times reported. But the World Bank's notion of the private sector has often been either a fraud or a political smokescreen. In the late 1980s, the World Bank touted its loans to Communist nations as private sector-oriented loans - one bait-and-switch too many, as I detailed in a 1988 Wall Street Journal article. And permitting the Bank to exonerate its handouts by counting illusory jobs created is a recipe for make-work scams.\n\nThe Covid pandemic provided the World Bank with the chance to play savior. In the first months of the pandemic, the Bank proudly announced that its \"emergency operations to fight COVID-19 (coronavirus) have reached 100 developing countries - home to 70% of the world's population.\" From April 2020 to March 2021, the World Bank \"committed over $200 billion, an unprecedented level of financial support, to public and private sector clients to fight the impacts of the pandemic. Our support is tailored to the health, economic, and social shocks that countries are facing.\" The fact that the World Bank was effectively financing governments to pointlessly shock their own nations was omitted from celebratory press releases.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank have helped turn many foreign nations into kleptocracies - governments of thieves. A 2002 American Economic Review analysis concluded that \"increases in [foreign] aid are associated with contemporaneous increases in corruption,\" and that \"corruption is positively correlated with aid received from the United States.\"\n\nMost importantly, neither the IMF nor the World Bank has any qualms about bankrolling tyranny. A 2015 report of the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, concluded that the World Bank \"now stands almost alone, along with the International Monetary Fund, in insisting that human rights are matters of politics which it must, as a matter of legal principle, avoid, rather than being an integral part of the international legal order.\"\n\nThe Bank justifies this position by insisting that it cannot involve \"itself in the partisan politics or ideological disputes that affect its member countries\" by improper methods such as \"favoring political factions, parties or candidates in elections,\" or \"endorsing or mandating a particular form of government, political bloc or political ideology.\"\n\nBut any time an international organization financially bails out a regime, it bolsters its power. After the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon coined a term that perfectly captures the effect of foreign aid: \"Money as a Weapon System.\" The 2015 UN report noted that \"the existing approach taken by the World Bank to human rights is incoherent, counterproductive and unsustainable. For most purposes, the World Bank is a human rights-free zone. In its operational policies, in particular, it treats human rights more like an infectious disease than universal values and obligations.\"\n\nThe World Bank actively blindfolds itself to avoid hearing about atrocities in nations ruled by governments that it is bankrolling. The Special Rapporteur noted, \"By refusing to take account of any information emanating from human rights sources, the Bank places itself in an artificial bubble.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's lust for \"doubling down\" on the IMF and World Bank is dicey to reconcile with their terminating 90% of foreign aid contracts from the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Cynics across the land rejoiced that Washington policymakers finally recognized one of the biggest swindles of the past 80 years.\n\nIf the Trump team can't even get sound policy on the World Bank, then what hope is there of them resolving any more complex challenges? I was briefly a consultant for the World Bank in the late 1980s, getting paid to co-author a report on the follies of farm subsidies. At that point, Reagan administration officials had periodically caterwauled about the Bank for almost a decade, and they were followed by sporadic howling by the US Treasury Department ever since. Secretary Bessent complained on Wednesday that the World Bank \"should no longer expect blank checks for vapid, buzzword-centric marketing accompanied by halfhearted commitments to reform.\" But after almost a half-century of failed US attempts to reform the Bank and IMF, there is no reason to expect any boondoggles to be left behind.\n\nOr do Trump's appointees believe that laundering U.S. tax dollars through international entities somehow makes them beneficent? Or maybe US Treasury Department honchos want to make sure they continue to get invited to the most lavish parties in D.C. and around the world. Regardless, the IMF and World Bank financing the worst Covid policies around the globe is another reminder of why those entities should be axed.",
