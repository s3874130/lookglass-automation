            "title": "South Korean Presidential Frontrunner Potentially Disqualified by Court Ruling",
            "body": "Lee Jae-myung, the front-running candidate in South Korea's special presidential election, may have been disqualified by a ruling from the Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nLee, the leader of the left-wing Democratic Party of Korea (DP), has been leading in the polls ever since President Yoon Suk-yeol of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) was impeached in December. Yoon was impeached for declaring martial law in December, ostensibly to combat \"subversive anti-state elements.\"\n\nSouth Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed Yoon from office on April 4, paving the way for a special election to replace him on June 3. The interim president who managed the office for most of the time since Yoon's impeachment, Han Duck-soo, resigned his position on Thursday and is expected to enter the race as a candidate.\n\n\"I have two paths ahead of me. One is completing the heavy responsibility that I handle now. The other is putting down that responsibility and taking a heavier responsibility. I've finally determined to put down my post to do what I can and what I have to help overcome the crises facing us,\" Han said on Thursday, strongly suggesting he has an eye on the upcoming election.\n\nHan's resignation would have bumped Minister of Economy and Finance Choi Sang-mok into the acting presidential hot seat -- except the opposition immediately filed a motion to impeach Choi, and he resigned from his office within a matter of hours.\n\nPPP lawmakers stormed out of the assembly hall to protest the impeachment vote against Choi, who has already been acting president once before, when the opposition impeached Han Duck-soo in December. The Supreme Court overturned that impeachment and reinstalled Han as the acting president in March.\n\nLee Jae-myung, who ran for president in 2022 and narrowly lost to Yoon, announced his intention to run again on April 10. He said income inequality and economic growth would be his top priorities.\n\n\"Our economy is in dire straits. The government's role is important, but for the past three years, the government has neglected the economy,\" he said when declaring his candidacy.\n\nThe DP formally nominated Lee as its candidate on Tuesday, giving him almost 90% of its votes. According to the most recent polls he is running far ahead of potential challenges with 38% support from the public. No other candidate is polling above 10% at the moment, although the conservative vote may coalesce around a single candidate when the PPP nominates its candidate next weekend.\n\n\"Now, the people and our party colleagues gave me an opportunity to win back the presidency and build a new, real Republic of Korea. Thank you! I'll humbly uphold that ardent,\" Lee said in his acceptance speech.\n\nUnfortunately for Lee, the Supreme Court might have bounced him out of the race on Thursday by overturning a previous ruling that cleared him of charges that he made \"false statements\" during his 2022 race against Yoon.\n\nLee is under investigation for several charges that would seem fairly serious, including corruption allegations linked to a real-estate scandal from his days as governor of Gyeonggi province, but the election law case was always seen as the one that might sink him, because he has already been found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison for it.\n\nLee was accused of making false statements on two occasions in 2021. In the first instance, he claimed he was coerced by the national Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport into rezoning some property to benefit a major development project while he was mayor of the city of Seongnam.\n\nLee's critics believe he made the controversial rezoning decision for his own personal financial benefit. The Land Ministry said Lee's story of coercion was false, and the ministry's position would ultimately be accepted by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe other allegedly false statement was made in December 2021, when Lee denied his links to the massive Seongnam real estate scandal. The court found Lee's denials were demonstrably false and intended to manipulate voters.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court found Lee guilty on both charges of making false statements in November 2024 and sentenced him to a year in prison. The sentence was suspended, but under South Korean law, the verdict was enough to disqualify him from running for office for at least five years.\n\nThe Seoul High Court overturned the Central District Court's ruling in March, clearing the way for Lee to run in the June presidential election. Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court, and on Thursday they won their case, as the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's ruling.\n\nChief Justice Jo Hee-de said on Thursday that Lee's statements in October and December 2021 were \"judged to be false statements on matters important enough to ruin voters' accurate judgement on the defendant's eligibility for public office.\"\n\nLee might have one more chance to stay in the race, as the Supreme Court tossed his case back down to the appellate court level for a new ruling. The Supreme Court moved very quickly to hear Lee's case, but the appeals court could take months before issuing a new ruling.\n\nIronically, the four serious corruption cases against Lee -- the very charges he was convicted of making false statements about in 2021 -- probably will not reach the courts until long after the June election, so they are not seen as serious impediments to his run.\n\nThere was a good deal of confusion among politicians, commentators, and legal experts in South Korea on Thursday over whether Lee can continue running for president after the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nPolitical consultant Park Sung-min told Nikkei Asia on Thursday that Lee can legally continue his campaign, and he probably will, but he probably shouldn't. If the appeals court moves as quickly as the Supreme Court did, a ruling could be dropped right in the middle of the campaign that forces Lee to suspend his candidacy.\n\n\"Lee will face pressure to resign as the court allows time for a change of candidate, but I think the Democratic Party will go ahead with him,\" Park predicted.\n\nThe DP held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss Lee's fate, and decided it would stick with him. The party criticized the Supreme Court ruling and said it has no plans to name an alternative candidate.\n\nPolitical analyst Rhee Jong-hoon told Reuters that whatever the DP might be saying in public, it will almost certainly discuss a \"Plan B\" behind closed doors, possibly including an outreach to minor parties to form a coalition around a different candidate.\n\n\"The appeals court will decide whether to disqualify him to run for office or not, but the Supreme Court in effect found him guilty,\" noted Myongji University political science professor Shin Yul. \"Moderate voters, 10% of the total, will be swayed by this news.\"\n\nLee himself seemingly argued that the election should be the ultimate verdict on his actions, rendered by the South Korean people.\n\n\"It was a totally different direction of ruling from what I thought,\" he said of the Supreme Court decision. \"Law is a consensus of people, and people's will matters the most.\"",

            "title": "Adams' $115B 'Best Budget Ever' is chocked full of freebies fit for...",
            "body": "Mayor Eric Adams served up a $115 billion election year spending plan Thursday that's stuffed with voter-pleasing goodies, but that was still slammed by critics for squirreling away relatively little for a rainy day.\n\nHizzoner, who faces an uphill re-election battle, unveiled his 2026 executive budget during a campaign-like event from his alma mater Bayside High School in Queens, rather than City Hall, from which such announcements have traditionally been done.\n\n\"This is not a budget that favors the few. It is budget for all of you,\" Adams said, while flanked by students. \"In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that our fiscal Year 2026 executive budget is the best budget ever.\"\n\nThe budget lavishes $1.4 billion on programs and services that had faced cuts -- such as libraries, early child education and the City University of New York.\n\nIt also launches a universal after-school program and increases education funding by $376 million.\n\nThe spending plan is the largest Adams has proposed since taking office in 2022, with last year's executive budget proposal coming in at $111.6 billion.\n\n\"Welcome to the election year!\" said veteran campaign strategist Hank Sheinkopf, adding that incumbent mayors usually throw caution to the wind when seeking a second term.\n\n\"An election year means living in the moment. Tomorrow, next year is a long time away,\" Sheinkopf told The Post. \"It's 'spend whatever we can now.' It's like a bank robbery.\"\n\nCritics quickly pounced on Adams seemingly failing to plan for the possibility of tough economic times in the near future, from President Trump's tariffs, a widely anticipated upcoming recession and potential federal funding cuts.\n\n\"Despite being flush with cash, Mayor Eric Adams' Fiscal Year 2026 Executive Budget fails to address the dual threats of looming federal budget cuts and a possible recession,\" said Andrew Rein, president of the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group Citizens Budget Commission.\n\n\"Instead of wisely adding $1 billion in next year's General Reserve to soften the first blows of federal cuts and $2 billion to the Rainy Day Fund, the budget increases spending to an unaffordable level.\"\n\nRein said the city should have between $8 and $10 billion in reserves for potential choppy economic waters -- a sum that city budget Director Jacques Jiha agreed would be needed, if the Big Apple were in a \"doomsday\" scenario.\n\n\"We're not looking at doomsday, we're looking at a slowdown in the economy,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe we have adequate reserves.\"\n\nAdams' preliminary budget, released in January, was blasted by opponents, including in the progressive City Council, for needlessly cutting services.\n\nBut his administration maintained those slashes were necessary due to skyrocketing costs from the migrant crisis -- which Jiha said has now cost the city more than $7 billion.\n\nThe mayor had begged Albany lawmakers in February for $1.1 billion to deal with the migrant crisis, contending then that the city needed it in 12 weeks.\n\nCity Hall officials offered nary a peep about the ask since then -- and the supposed shortfall apparently has been covered by savings, with Jiha saying only \"Money is fungible\" as an explanation.\n\nThe budget announced Thursday is Adams' first since the crisis largely subsided, and includes these spending increases and reversed cuts:\n\n\"Adams is using this budget to promote his re-election. He doesn't want to have much of a fight with the council,\" said Nicole Gelinas, senior fellow at the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"It's pre-emptive capitulation to the council,\" she added, noting Adams was proposing $1.7 billion more in spending compared to his preliminary budget.\n\n\"Adams is blowing out the agency spending,\" Gelinas said. \"[He] is squandering the last of his budget credibility.\"\n\nNot all programs and departments saw a funding increase. The following budget cuts were included in the plan:\n\nTalks with City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is not related to Hizzoner and is running for the Democratic mayoral nomination, will continue until the June 30 deadline to pass the budget.\n\nAdams' plan offered plenty of fodder from candidates hoping to boot him from Gracie Mansion, such as City Comptroller Brad Lander -- who claimed the mayor was \"failing to protect New Yorkers\" by not putting more cash in reserves.\n\nFormer city comptroller and current mayoral candidate Scott Stringer also blasted Adams for failing to prepare for a potential \"extraordinary loss of funding for New York City.\"\n\nAdrienne Adams offered less gloom and doom -- though she still cautioned against getting too comfortable.\n\n\"I think that the budget right now is good, but we can never be too certain about what is coming around the corner with this Trump administration,\" she said.\n\nAdams, who boasted of confronting then-President Joe Biden for migrant funding, hasn't been nearly as vocal about his growing ally Trump.\n\nHe said he hasn't been in contact with the White House, even as he acknowledged that the current global climate was creating \"uncharted waters.\"\n\nAdams' top deputy, however, was quick to put a positive spin on the potential financial woes.\n\n\"We are best positioned to address with Washington those issues going forward,\" said First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro. \"Even asking a question about a doomsday scenario is to be with those pessimistic and political opportunists who don't bet on New York, who are saying, 'The sky is falling.'",

            "body": "Warning: This story contains an image of a Nazi symbol.\n\nThousands of campaign posters -- cable-tied to fences and lining the streets -- each emblazoned with a candidate's name and portrait.\n\nAnd while stealing or vandalising corflutes isn't new, political experts are warning dirty tactics are becoming more common in some tight electorates.\n\nElection signs have been marked with swastikas or offensive slurs, burned, vandalised, smeared with excrement, stomped on and shredded, especially in marginal seats.\n\nPolitics lecturer Dr Blair Williams from Monash University said the high volume of reports, and their severity, was worrying.\n\n\"Much of what we're seeing on corflutes kind of relates to that increased polarisation, increased normalisation of hate speech,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not surprising that we're seeing that trickle down into politics on the streets.\"\n\nSome vandals caught on camera\n\nIn the marginal seat of Mackellar in Sydney's north, independent MP Sophie Scamps said about 500 of her electoral signs had been \"slashed and destroyed\" over the past month.\n\nPictures circulating on social media show a man appearing to take down a number of Ms Scamps's posters and using a knife to shred them.\n\n\"People find such aggression at best puerile, at worst deeply threatening,\" Ms Scamps said.\n\n\"The electorate has been covered in bright yellow, denigrating and misleading posters and ads about me. After the actions of Professor Malham in Kooyong have illustrated, I'm not sure we can say this is just healthy democracy.\"\n\nMs Scamps was referring to Melbourne neurosurgeon, Professor Greg Malham, after a video circulated of a man tearing down a poster of independent MP Monique Ryan in the marginal Melbourne seat of Kooyong.\n\nNine Newspapers reported Professor Malham admitted to being the man in the video and apologised.\n\nMs Ryan told the ABC the video was \"deeply concerning\" but was far from an isolated incident.\n\n\"We've seen groups from both within and outside Kooyong stoking division through aggressively negative advertising,\" she said.\n\n\"It's creating a climate of hostility that is distressing to candidates, volunteers, and the broader community.\"\n\n\"There's no place in Australian electoral campaigns or society for violence and aggression.\"\n\nMs Ryan said more than 200 of her corflutes had been torn down and defaced, sometimes with very distressing messages or symbols put on them.\n\n\"It's been a really tough election campaign nationally, things are heightened, and there's a lot of tension,\" she said.\n\nMs Ryan herself copped criticism earlier in the campaign, after her husband was caught on video removing a sign of her Liberal opponent Amelia Hamer.\n\nPeter Jordan apologised for the incident, saying he believed the sign was illegally placed.\n\n'Violent' vandalism and incidents of physical assault\n\nSome attacks on signage have also turned physically violent.\n\nIn Ashfield in Sydney's inner west, a 79-year-old man was taken to hospital in a serious condition after an alleged assault outside a polling booth in Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's electorate of Grayndler.\n\nThe ABC understands the elderly man was confronted after defacing one of Mr Albanese's corflutes. A 17-year-old boy has been charged over the incident.\n\nElsewhere in Sydney, in the seat of Bennelong, a 30-year-old man was charged with intimidation after kicking a number of signs and allegedly becoming aggressive towards volunteers at the booth.\n\nA number of police investigations have been conducted in the hotly-contested seat of Calare in the New South Wales Central West, where the Nationals are hoping to win against sitting independent Andrew Gee.\n\nIn a statement, Detective Inspector Jason Darcy said there had been examples of malicious damage and people being abusive to others at a number of polling centres across NSW \"due to heightened emotions ahead of the federal election\".\n\n\"The message is clear -- this is not what police want to see and there will be no tolerance for any behaviour that could harm others at any time anywhere,\" Detective Inspector Darcy said.\n\n\"It is disappointing when it seems to be conveying a bit of violence,\" independent candidate Kate Hook said.\n\nOther corflutes in the electorate have been targeted with racist remarks or stolen, while Nazi symbols have been scrawled on billboards.\n\nIn another marginal seat, Liberal candidate for Wentworth Ro Knox has also had hundreds of posters vandalised or stolen -- some even set on fire or smeared with animal faeces.\n\nMany in the Sydney seat, currently held by independent Allegra Spender, have also been vandalised with anti-Semitic symbols and language.\n\nMs Knox said she understood many residents were fed up with the \"poster wars\", and pledged to not use campaign posters on public property in the next campaign if elected.\n\n\"We're all over the waste, the visual pollution, the silly games where people are tearing down and defacing posters,\" she said.\n\nDeputy Greens leader Mehreen Faruqi, whose signs have been targeted, said the problem was getting worse.\n\n\"What's happening out there clearly goes beyond ordinary vandalism -- this is politically motivated hate,\" she told the ABC.\n\nAustralian National University political marketing lecturer Andrew Hughes said the worst instances of vandalism appeared to be in seats with three of four candidates, particularly where a teal or independent candidate was running.\n\n\"All of a sudden a lot of these races are too hard to call so people revert to, sadly, aggressive behaviour like this to get their candidate elected again,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to accept we're entering a new era where traditional two-way races between major party candidates will become a thing of the past in some areas, even areas where we thought that wouldn't happen like Calare, like Wannon.\"\n\nMr Hughes said the behaviour actually worked against the candidate the vandal thought they were helping.\n\n\"You notice the sign left untouched and then people start thinking: 'Hang on, that party's playing dirty,'\" he said.\n\nPauline Hanson's One Nation party has also been targeted, with a man who hid his face with a mask caught on video slashing through candidate Stuart Bonds's corflutes in the electorate of Hunter in New South Wales.\n\nFrustrated locals or far-right actors?\n\nSo who is behind the attacks? Dr Blair Williams said the culprits were likely a mix of bored teenagers, supporters of political opponents, and extremists. And in many instances, it's hard to tell.\n\n\"I can imagine some of the people stealing signs would be frustrated community members ... whether it be the cost of living crisis or what's happening in Gaza,\" she said.\n\n\"But then there are the more insidious actors. In the last federal election some corflutes were defaced by neo-Nazi groups with neo-Nazi signage, and you're seeing some more hate speech vandalism as well this election.\"",

            "body": "The United States has finally acknowledged the truth: Sex-change treatments endanger children.\n\nOn Thursday, the federal Department of Health and Human Services issued the world's most comprehensive report on the topic to date -- a definitive 400-page evidentiary and ethical takedown.\n\nTransgender activists have long relied on the support of the US government -- or at least its silence -- to protect their claimed medical and moral legitimacy and continue treatment on children as young as age 8.\n\nNow they have nowhere to turn but the fringe, which is where their ideology arose and ought to return.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about this report is that it took so long.\n\nOther nations, especially in Europe, have conducted their own reviews of the evidence in recent years.\n\nThey have broadly concluded that treatments like puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex-change surgeries have more documented risks than potential benefits for children.\n\nLast summer, for example, Great Britain all but banned the use of puberty blockers -- the first and foundational treatment in child sex-change procedures -- after the publication of a National Health Service report by Dr. Hilary Cass.\n\nYet the US government has refused to grapple with the evidence, much less admit it, until now.\n\nIn the meantime, at least 14,000 American children have been subjected to these interventions, as our organization has documented.\n\nThe HHS report notes from the start that medical practitioners have a \"professional and ethical obligation to protect and promote their patients' health.\"\n\nThat obligation strongly counsels against hormones and surgeries for children, since, as the report notes, there's little evidence of benefits of sex-change treatments -- but plenty of proof of their harm.\n\nThe evidence shows that sex changes for children can lead to infertility, sterility, cognitive problems, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, mental-health disorders and more.\n\nAnd, as the report also notes, additional suffering may soon come to light -- because existing studies fail \"to systematically track and report harms.\"\n\nWe already know, as the report makes clear, that child sex changes are happening amid a broader mental-health crisis among kids.\n\nPsychotherapy, not experimental drugs and invasive surgeries, is necessary to treat underlying mental issues like anxiety and depression.\n\nActivists have mischaracterized psychotherapy as \"conversion therapy,\" the HHS report notes -- yet Britain and the Scandinavian countries now recommend these non-invasive treatments as the primary intervention.\n\nThe unnamed authors don't mince words about what medical professionals should -- and shouldn't -- do in cases of gender distress.\n\n\"When medical interventions pose unnecessary, disproportionate risks of harm, health care providers should refuse to offer them,\" they instruct, \"even when they are preferred, requested, or demanded by patients.\"\n\nFailing to heed this guidance, they write, threatens the foundations of medicine itself.\n\nHonest medical practitioners and experts have known from the beginning that child transgender treatments are risky and largely experimental.\n\nYet honesty was never the goal for many activists, as the HHS report also shows.\n\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which publishes the most widely used child treatment guidelines, \"suppressed systematic reviews its leaders believed would undermine its favored treatment approach.\"\n\nWPATH's guideline developers also \"eliminated nearly all recommended age minimums for medical and surgical interventions in response to political pressures.\"\n\nThis is the definition of putting ideology ahead of evidence.\n\nNow the HHS report must shape government action.\n\nIt provides the necessary scientific support to implement President Trump's January order to \"take all appropriate actions to end\" treatments that endanger children.\n\nThat could include ending Medicare and Medicaid coverage of such treatments -- and perhaps private health-insurance coverage as well.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget has sought to block federal research and education grants to institutions that perform child sex-change treatments, and the report adds weight to that effort.\n\nThe findings should also spur National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to release the results of its decade-long study on the effects of puberty-blocking drugs on children.\n\nThat study's author, prominent transgender activist Johanna Olson-Kennedy, has refused to release the data -- while admitting they didn't show promised mental-health improvements.\n\nNIH should now fund new, non-biased studies to analyze the effects of sex-change treatments on those who received them as children, including the rates of regret and the prevalence of de-transitioning.\n\nThursday's report proves that our federal government is finally willing to put medical science ahead of gender activism.\n\nWashington has sided with ideologues for too long, giving cover to the notion that sex changes for children are consequence-free and medically necessary.\n\nIn fact, the proven harms outweigh unproven benefits.\n\nBy finally speaking truth to the activists' power, the United States has taken the most important global step yet in protecting children from transgender ideology.",
