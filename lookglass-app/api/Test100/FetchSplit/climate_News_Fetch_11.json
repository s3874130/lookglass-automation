            "title": "How MAGA is waging a 'fight for the soul of the Catholic Church'",
            "body": "When the Catholic cardinals enter the conclave to elect the next pope, MAGA faithful will be hoping a conservative tribune emerges victorious.\n\nThe \"fight for the soul of the Catholic Church\" is happening, and it's between those leaders who saw promise in the modernising changes Pope Francis made and those \"who hated him for it\", according to religious scholars.\n\nWhen Jorge Mario Bergoglio was introduced to the world as the next pope in 2013, he took the name Francis -- a name no pope had ever taken.\n\nSaint Francis of Assisi represented the poor, the humble and was the patron saint of ecology.\n\nPope Francis would come to make his papacy in that image.\n\nHe was not a perfect progressive ally and, for many, his promises of change remain just that, but for an institution that measures time in centuries, Pope Francis represented a new, much more open era.\n\nFor many Catholics, it was extraordinary to hear a pontiff talk about his own sins and to hear him say: \"If someone is gay and he searches for the Lord and has good will, who am I to judge?\"\n\nPope Francis offered the 1.4 billion followers of the Catholic faith across the world a voice of modern morality -- he sought to care for them, and was concerned more with how the church could improve their lives than theological doctrine.\n\nBut for his critics, Pope Francis veered too far from the religion's rules, and threatened to change them.\n\nIn particular, as he made statements about climate change, immigration and same-sex marriage, Pope Francis clashed with an ideological force taking over the Republican Party in the United States.\n\nNow, data shows American Catholics are split unlike any other major religion.\n\nBecause for decades, the architects of the so-called religious right in the United States have been building a coalition of church-going voters.\n\nThese Americans can be relied upon to show up on election day and to vote for the candidate who promises to uphold the idea of traditional Christian family values.\n\nTheir politics and their faith are fused.\n\nThere have been some obvious galvanising causes -- the movement is against access to abortion, it is for the homeschooling of children. It holds very traditional views for the role of women and it does not want the United States to be multicultural.\n\nMormons as well as Southern Baptists and followers of a list of other Protestant evangelical faiths are now the most likely to vote Republican and, according to religious scholars, hold the most socially conservative views.\n\nAgainst this backdrop, there was a risk the Catholic Church led by Pope Francis could be seen as a more liberal faith in the United States.\n\nJoe Biden, after all, is a proud Catholic.\n\nBut then so is Steve Bannon, and like other MAGA players, he wants Catholicism to be reclaimed for conservatives.\n\nA US cardinal has never been pope, reportedly because the Vatican has viewed the nation has having too much influence over the church.\n\nThere are reports conservative American Catholics are in Rome right now, lobbying for an outcome in their favour.\n\nSo the stage is set. MAGA followers want the next pope to bring Catholicism back to its roots, but part of the legacy of Francis is that he had long been preparing to stop them.\n\nPope Francis vs MAGA\n\nOnce upon a time, JD Vance called himself an atheist and a \"never Trumper\". Now, he's Donald Trump's vice president and the poster boy for a new era of American Catholicism.\n\nVance's path to personal and political redemption led him to sit opposite Pope Francis just hours before the pontiff died.\n\nIt was a moment religious scholars have reflected on as one of great symbolism because it was a meeting of two very different movements -- Pope Francis as the church's truth itself, and Vance, someone who represents the outlier US traditionalism has become.\n\nThe issue that helps explain the diverging of Pope Francis and MAGA most clearly perhaps is immigration and the treatment of migrants.\n\nThe Trump administration has taken a hardline approach on immigration and is planning the mass deportation of migrants, while it forcibly detains and deports some who are in the country legally.\n\nFrancis called Trump's immigration plans a \"disgrace\" and criticised his cuts to foreign aid and domestic welfare programs.\n\nIn 2016, Pope Francis went so far as to say Trump was \"not Christian\" -- again over his approach to immigration and the building of his border wall.\n\nPope Francis was a man who washed the feet of prisoners -- who believed the people of the world were equalised by their very humanity.\n\nHe was the son of Italian immigrants himself and placed the plight of migrants and refugees at the heart of his moral agenda during his 12-year papacy.\n\nA few months ago, JD Vance attempted to use a theological concept to justify the Trump administration's mass deportation plan and Pope Francis promptly corrected him.\n\nOn Fox News, Vance spoke about the order of love.\n\n\"There's this old school -- and I think it's a very Christian -- concept by the way, that you love your family, and then you love your neighbour, and then you love your community, then you love your fellow citizens in your own country, and then after that you can focus and prioritise the rest of the world,\" he said.\n\nLess than a fortnight later, Pope Francis penned a rare open letter to all US Catholic bishops, once again slamming Trump's immigration policy and directly refuting Vance's interpretation of the concept of ordo amoris, or order of love.\n\n\"Christian love is not a concentric expansion of interests that little by little extend to other persons and groups,\" he wrote.\n\n\"The true ordo amoris that must be promoted is that which we discover by meditating constantly on the parable of the 'Good Samaritan' ... by meditating on the love that builds a fraternity open to all, without exception.\"\n\nProfessor of religion at Dartmouth College Randall Balmer told the ABC Pope Francis took issue with Vance's suggestion love could be prioritised.\n\n\"Vance was trying to use that as a justification for Trump's immigration policies and turning people away from US borders and Francis was having none of it,\" he said.\n\n\"Vance has been trying to cloak his policies, and by extension, cloak Trump's policies in Catholic doctrine and Catholic social teaching, but Francis was pretty quick to disavow that connection.\"\n\nConservatives were unhappy with Pope Francis from the start because of his informal style, his aversion to pomp and his decision to allow women and people of the Muslim faith to take part in a Holy Thursday ritual that previously had been restricted to Catholic men.\n\nThey baulked at his approval of conditional blessings for same-sex couples and Pope Francis's repeated clampdowns on the use of Latin Mass.\n\nMAGA firebrand, self-styled media mogul, and former Donald Trump advisor Steve Bannon has been a vocal critic of Pope Francis, and after the pontiff's death, has been all over YouTube talking about his work to drag the church backwards.\n\nHe believes that is what a rising tide of American Catholics want.\n\n\"This is another massive institution that means so much about turning our world around. The Catholic Church has been taken over by these globalists and it's not good, really not good,\" he said on his War Room program.\n\nHe told Piers Morgan: \"I think a lot of people, particularly the rising part of the church in America would at least like to see a pope that is accessible to traditional teachings and gets the Catholic Church back on an orthodox pattern.\"\n\n\"I have been very open. I've worked for years with more of the conservative, traditionalist cardinals and people at the Vatican ... it's been a very tough and vicious fight and this will continue on.\"\n\nTaking a look at the data, there are some clear trends that help explain just how divided the Catholic Church is in the United States and how Donald Trump arrived at just the right time.\n\nReligious support for Trump\n\nPope Francis was just a few years into his papacy when Donald Trump announced his candidacy for president of the United States in 2015.\n\nAmericans of faith had been trending Republican, and were then presented with a candidate who very loudly promised to answer their call.\n\n\"There's some sort of visceral way that people in the religious right, white evangelicals and I would add, traditionalist Catholics, see themselves as being victims in this multicultural society,\" Dr Balmer said.\n\n\"They see themselves somehow as being kicked to the sidelines. And [think] 'we need to fight back', 'we need to resist that in some way', and Trump speaks that language, I think, very, very fluently'.\"\n\nHe tells his base \"we have to somehow vanquish our enemies or deport them ... in order to reassert that hegemonic hold on society\", Dr Balmer said.\n\nHe would eventually build some of the wall he promised.\n\nAnd deliver the US Supreme Court and its overturning of Roe v Wade -- the case that served as a lightning rod for religious conservatives.\n\nDonald Trump has long been able to rely on his loyal evangelical base and in his 2024 general election win, Trump did as well among that group as he did in his 2020 loss.\n\nBut Trump is winning more of the Catholic vote, while Democrats are losing their grip on it, according to AP Vote Cast.\n\nAnd according to the latest survey by Pew Research Centre, 53 per cent of American Catholics now identify or lean Republican. In 2014, that number was 37 per cent.\n\nThere are other trends too.\n\nAmerican Catholics are also split on racial lines and, in recent years, on their opinion of Pope Francis.\n\nSenior associate director at Pew Research Gregory Smith said in the early years of his papacy, Pope Francis was viewed favourably by American Catholics across the political spectrum.\n\n\"But the share of Catholic Republicans who had a favourable view of Francis began to trend downward, and so you saw this gap open up between Catholic Democrats and Republicans,\" he said.\n\nAt the far-right end of that spectrum is a group of American Catholics who want more than their man at the head of the church, but for the United States itself to become more religious.\n\n'A fight for the soul of the Catholic Church'\n\nThe conservative swing inside the Catholic Church in America echoes the rise of the right across the world, according to professor of religious studies at the University of Florida and scholar of the religious right Julie Ingersol.\n\n\"The rise of this very conservative form of Catholicism is, in some ways, a reaction to the kinds of things that Pope Francis did and supported,\" she said.\n\n\"He stepped away from focus on the culture war divisions, and tried to focus more just on people, recognising that people had all kinds of differences.\"\n\nDr Ingersol studies Christian nationalism and said the Catholic thread in American conservatism ultimately wants to see \"more of a union of the church and the state\".\n\n\"There's always been a thread in American Catholicism that is deeply conservative, and it parallels some of the developments in Protestantism that are working for a theocracy,\" she said.\n\nIn JD Vance they see \"one of their own\" and \"their version of Catholicism near the top of American power\", Dr Ingersol said.\n\nJust as traditionalist Catholics have ascended to those heights in the United States, there is an opening at the top of the Vatican and a chance to own the church's next era too.\n\nPope Francis knew he faced fierce opposition inside the Vatican and while he largely ignored it while he was alive, he prepared for the fight that would happen after his death.\n\nLate Australian cardinal George Pell once penned a memo declaring his papacy \"a catastrophe\".\n\nUS cardinal and dominant figure among traditionalist American Catholics Raymond Burke once said the church under Francis was \"a ship without a rudder\".\n\nPope Francis would later strip Burke of some of his Vatican privileges. He also stood down a deeply conservative, social media-loving, Trump-supporting bishop in Texas who took issue with his statements on the LGBTQIA+ community.\n\nOf the cardinals who will vote to elect his successor, Pope Francis stacked the house and appointed 80 per cent of them, so the maths isn't in his critics' favour.\n\nBut as in politics, the vote can always swing.\n\nNo matter who is elected the next pope, they will have to contend with a US arm of the Catholic Church that is split.\n\nBeyond the culture wars that Donald Trump so easily stokes, Dr Balmer believes \"the real battleground\" could become the issue of Latin Mass.\n\n\"They may want to agitate to continue their use of the Latin Mass and maybe expand it beyond what he wanted. At certain certain point, you have to ask: ... is this a church going in two different directions?\" he said.\n\n\"If there's a division over that, then in some sense, you're not talking about a single church any longer.\"",

            "title": "'Inherently destructive': Trump moves world a step closer to commercial deep-sea mining",
            "body": "From the middle of July, nations will gather in Jamaica to resume International Seabed Authority meetings to discuss developments on deep-sea mining and a moratorium.\n\nLying at the bottom of the ocean, thousands of metres below the surface, are reserves of what are considered to be the world's most critical minerals.\n\nIn the Pacific Ocean between North America and Hawaii lies a large area known as the Clarion-Clipperton zone -- a particularly abundant area filled with copper, cobalt and nickel.\n\nNow, the race is on to start mining these minerals.\n\nUS President Donald Trump has signed an executive order to open both US and international waters to deep-sea mining, ignoring a global treaty that controls the high seas.\n\nThe order was signed last week with the aim of boosting US production of critical minerals by mining mineral-rich \"nodules\" that take millions of years to form on the seabed.\n\nThe race to the seabed\n\nThe order states its purpose is to \"establish the United States as a global leader in responsible seabed mineral exploration\".\n\nThe race to the seabed has also sparked fear among environmentalists that it could permanently damage marine life.\n\nThe United Nations, environmental groups and a number of countries -- including China -- have accused Donald Trump of violating international law in ordering the fast-tracking of approval processes for deep-sea mining in US waters and international waters.\n\nThe order sidesteps the UN's International Seabed Authority, which has prevented such mining in international waters while it works on governance frameworks.\n\nScientists and climate activists also warn that changes to biodiversity could be irreversible if commercial mining of the seabed goes ahead.\n\nThirty-two countries are calling for a moratorium or precautionary ban until more is understood about the deep sea.\n\n\"There's a lot of species that depend directly or indirectly on the nodules to live because they live on top, underneath or around the nodules,\" deep-sea ecologist Dr Patricia Esquete said.\n\nCountries including France have applied international pressure on the Australian government to ratify a high seas treaty protecting deep-sea biodiversity beyond national jurisdictions.\n\nWhile it appears that will happen by June, calls from the UK and some Pacific Island nations for Australia to join a moratorium on deep-sea mining have not been answered.\n\nWhat is deep-sea mining? And who wants to do it?\n\nDeep-sea mining is the extraction of minerals -- mainly polymetallic nodules rich in cobalt, nickel, and manganese -- that lie on the seabed at about 4,000 metres below sea-level.\n\nCountries have the right to regulate mining activities within their exclusive economic zones.\n\nThe International Seabed Authority (ISA), established under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea, regulates mining in areas beyond national jurisdiction.\n\nA Canadian mining company has sought a permit from the Trump administration to begin commercial deep-sea mining in the Clarion-Clipperton zone, which some experts have described as a breach of international law.\n\nThe Metals Company (TMC) last month announced on its website it was seeking a permit to begin mining in international waters.\n\nThis week, it has submitted a commercial recovery permit under the US Deep Seabed Hard Mineral Resources Act.\n\nTMC has been one of many companies and countries undertaking exploratory work in the deep sea, spending hundreds of millions of dollars examining various minerals.\n\nHowever, given how little is known about the deep sea, rules and regulations for commercial mining, created by the ISA, will not be ready for several more years.\n\n\"[TMC] realised that they're not going to get a mining permit through the ISA anytime soon,\" said Phil McCabe from the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.\n\n\"A few weeks ago, they told the world that actually we're going to bypass the ISA and we're going to go for the USA ...\n\n\"We need more information, more scientific information and that takes time,\" Mr McCabe said.\n\nTMC chief executive Gerard Barron told ABC News the company first collected nodules at a commercial scale in 2022 and that \"the missing piece has really been the regulatory certainty\".\n\nThe ISA has condemned the announcement from TMC, stating the company \"continues to disregard all scientific and economic warnings about the industry's risks\".\n\nRick Valenta, director of the Sustainable Minerals Institute at the University of Queensland, said the zone covers an area \"just under 80 per cent of the size of Australia\" and granted license area is \"about the size of Tasmania\".\n\nThe Department of Foreign Affairs and Trade told ABC News that Australia doesn't condone deep-sea mining beyond national jurisdiction without the regulatory framework currently being negotiated by the ISA.\n\nHowever, DFAT said TMC's announcement of a proposed application is a matter for TMC and the US government.\n\nInformation void as research in its infancy\n\nDeep-sea ecologist Dr Esquete said because the deep sea has been so difficult to access, research in these parts of the world is only in its \"infancy\".\n\n\"It's been overlooked for many years, so we're just starting to understand and starting to reach ecosystems that had not been reached for decades,\" she told ABC News.\n\nA recent study in the journal Nature analysed the impacts on a 46-year-old test mining site in the Clarion-Clipperton zone.\n\n\"We found persistent impacts, lasting for nearly half a century, to the seabed environment and particularly the larger animals living in the area,\" UK National Oceanography Centre biogeosciences head Daniel Jones said.\n\n\"We also found the first early signs of a recovery process starting to take place, with some mobile animals returning to the tracks and shelled-amoeba-like xenophyophores recolonising.\n\n\"This early snapshot of ecological succession, where the species change over time, is what happens in most ecosystems after disturbance.\n\nThe study looked at a 400-square-metre impact site but the ISA has granted 17 exploration contracts to would-be miners covering a total area of 1.28 million square kilometres.\n\nMr Barron said TMC has spent \"hundreds of millions of dollars\" over the past 14 years on environmental research to understand the impact of commercial deep-sea mining.\n\n\"Comparing those impacts to land-based alternatives, studying the recovery rates, and what the conclusions all point to is that the impacts are a fraction compared to land-based alternatives,\" he said.\n\nBut Dr Esquete believes the environmental impacts will be \"way higher\" than what TMC tries to portray.\n\n\"They are very special because they are completely different from any other environment on earth.\n\n\"They have very special adaptations from which we can learn from and learn about the origin of life.\"\n\nWhat this means for international law\n\nInternational environmental lawyer Duncan Currie said even though the US hasn't ratified the ISA, it has signed a more recent 1994 agreement, meaning the US is \"bound by the law of the sea conventions\".\n\n\"It's essentially the crucial provision about the deep sea being of common heritage of humankind ... at the very least, what's called customary international law, which means binding on everybody,\" he said.\n\nMr Currie said one of his biggest concerns of this possible permit is what it means for international law.\n\n\"The Sea Convention also controls things like freedom of navigation, maritime boundaries, fishing rights [and] the Marine scientific research,\" he said.\n\n\"...the whole host of really important matters, which are absolutely crucial to many, many countries come under the governance of the UN Convention on Law of the Sea.\n\n\"So if one country is driving a coach and horses through the law of the sea convention ... then I think many countries are going to be deeply concerned about that.\"\n\nSea law expert Karen Scott has another view -- that because the US was not a party to the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS), in principle there was nothing to prevent it from developing its own regime.\n\nBut Professor Scott, from New Zealand's University of Canterbury, said one section of UNCLOS, part XI, could still be binding as customary international law.\n\nIndigenous community concerned about impact\n\nAmong those worried about the effects of deep-sea mining are Indigenous people from the New Ireland Province in Papua New Guinea.\n\nJonathan Mesulam is the founder and coordinator of West Coast Development Foundation, a PNG-based non-governmental organisation.\n\nHe is working to promote conservation and warned the effects of deep-sea mining won't just affect the ocean.\n\n\"In New Ireland we have this culture where people go out, go out and catch the fish ... what will we tell our kids, the future generation, that we want to have this kind of culture.\n\n\"If we destroy our culture, then we will destroy our identity.\"\n\nIn the Cook Islands, Prime Minister Mark Brown is supportive of deep-sea mining, telling ABC News' The Pacific program that it could unlock access to financing which would build resilience against the impacts of climate change.\n\nBut ocean conservation advocate Lousia Castledine, who lives in the South Pacific's largest island, Rarotonga, said she is concerned about the environmental, cultural, social, and spiritual impacts of the industry.\n\n\"What we see here is a shift from protecting our environment that has long sustained us as a people to exploiting it in a way that is irreversible,\" the spokesperson for Ocean Ancestors said.\n\nCalls for a moratorium\n\nPhil McCabe has been one of the key figures pushing for a moratorium over the last five years under the Deep Sea Conservation Coalition.\n\n\"Anything that puts peace and security at risk just needs to be looked at really carefully,\" he said.\n\n\"We are much better off to take some time and gather the scientific knowledge and understanding that enables proper evidence based decisions around it.\"\n\nBut he said he is \"completely bewildered\" as to why Australia hasn't shown its support.\n\n\"There's no benefit to Australia from deep-sea mining going ahead in international waters, there's no commercial interest from Australian entities. If anything, opening up the deep sea and minerals that exist there could negatively impact Australia's economy,\" he said.\n\nDFAT told ABC News that Australia participates in the negotiations surrounding a framework that will govern deep-sea mining and recognises there are a range of views around the mining.\n\nIt added that Australia supports Pacific Island countries to manage their own ocean resources.\n\nSamantha Climie has been making representations to the federal government on behalf of Look Down Action -- a youth organisation rallying to stop deep-sea mining -- and said Australia has an \"important role to play\".\n\n\"Australia very much positions itself as a leader in the Pacific and wants to support a lot of Pacific Island nations,\" she said.\n\nMs Climie said she has reached out to the government but hasn't received a response to date.\n\n\"I think it's really important and urgent that Australia does [join the call for a moratorium] in the lead up to the ISA's meeting in July.\"\n\nFrom the middle of July, nations will gather in Jamaica to resume the ISA Council and Assembly Meetings to discuss developments on deep-sea mining and the moratorium.\n\nAs scientists and conservationists warn just how much is at stake, the US executive order means the race towards commercial mining has already started.",

It will also be biodegradable and \"innovative and ethically sound.\"\n\nUnlike naysayers, Connon said it will soon become a reality.\n\n\"The hard bit is making leather from cells, and we've done that,\" Connon told The Post. \"The upstream bit is using existing technologies, which is why we're confident we can do this so quickly.\"\n\nThe initial implementation of T. rex leather will focus on accessories with a goal to produce a flagship commercial luxury fashion item by the end of the year.\n\nEventually, once production gets larger, this could open the door to possibilities beyond the fashion industry, such as the automotive sector.\n\n\"With T-Rex leather we're harnessing the biology of the past to create the luxury materials of the future,\" Bas Korsten, Global Chief Creative Officer, Innovation & CCO EMEA at VML, said in a statement.\n\n\"Part of it is the fact that it's demonstrating that you can start to create new materials that have never been formed before,\" Connon said. \"So the same process could be used to create much stronger, for example, or change color or a whole host of things that are feasible but have never been seen before.\"\n\nIn order to create it, synthetic DNA will be used to engineer cells that will then be integrated into an Elemental-X product stream, utilizing a scaffold-free approach that allows the cells to merge in their own natural structure.\n\nConnon explained that he and his team spent 15 years in university doing tissue engineering, then three to four years at the company to get to the point of making the skin and the leather.\n\n\"This project is a remarkable example of how we can harness cutting-edge genome and protein engineering to create entirely new materials,\" Thomas Mitchell, CEO of The Organoid Company, commented.\n\n\"By reconstructing and optimizing ancient protein sequences, we can design T. Rex leather, a biomaterial inspired by prehistoric biology, and clone it into a custom-engineered cell line.\"\n\nAccording to VML, the T. rex leather is a cell-grown performance material that is more than just imitation and provides the natural durability, repairability and tactility that's already expected in high-end luxury leather goods.\n\nHowever, not all scientists are digging the revelations. One dinosaur expert told Live Science he thinks the claim of making T. rex leather is \"misleading\" and \"what this company is doing seems to be fantasy.\"\n\n\"We have NO preserved tyrannosaurid DNA (indeed, not Mesozoic dinosaur DNA sequences), so there are no T. rex genes,\" Thomas Holtz, Jr., a vertebrate paleontologist at the University of Maryland, told the outlet.\n\nDNA starts to decay as soon as an animal dies, though some fragments might remain in the environment for a few million years. The oldest preserved DNA on record is about 2 million years old, and the T. rex went extinct 66 million years ago.\n\nHoltz added that paleontologists have only found T. rex collagen in bone, not skin, which is the basis for leather, and that researchers don't have access to good tyrannosaurid skin samples since it's rarely preserved in fossils.\n\nSome experts are less skeptical, noting that while it may be possible, any chance of getting results soon isn't likely, and when they do, it'll be expensive.\n\nThe \"gimmick\" is at a \"very early stage,\" Tom Ellis, professor of synthetic genome engineering at Imperial College London, told NBC. \"I doubt that our knowledge of dinosaur evolution is good enough to be able to design a collagen gene specifically from T. rex.\"\n\nEllis added that producing real T. rex leather is \"very far-fetched,\" and the properties of any collagen results are likely to be similar to those of a cow or chicken, which means that it would look and feel the same as any other alternative leather.\n\nThough the T. rex collagen \"gives them something that is at least unique and can justify a much higher price,\" he said.\n\nBut Connon rebuked the notion that it's not possible, telling The Post that \"some people have got the wrong end of the stick saying, well, you can't do it. That's not true.\"\n\n\"Some of that seems to be around, there is no T-Rex skin, but leather isn't skin. It's a component of skin,\" he explained. \"So that's a bit of confusion there. The technologies there are incredible, but they are very much there. And I think the challenge is, there's a lot to bring people up to speed with.\"\n\nAs he explained, the collagen fragments extracted are available from blood vessels or micro-vessels in bone, and the blood vessels have the same biological makeup as skin. \"It's the structural part of the skin, which forms leather.\"\n\n\"People aren't aware of all the different technologies or aware that they exist, so putting them together is quite a bit of a mental leap for people,\" Connon said. \"But rest assured, these are all things that have been proven.\"\n\nThe researchers also stressed the environmental and ethical consequences of the lab-grown leather as well. Since traditional leather production is a component of extensive deforestation and the tanning process often uses harmful chemicals, this new approach can not only reduce negative environmental impacts but also put an end to animal cruelty concerns.\n\n\"Dinosaurs evolved to survive in extreme environments -- conditions our planet is once again beginning to face due to accelerated climate change,\" the news release also explained.",

            "body": "The agents took a knee - a gesture to express dissent against perceived racial injustices - during Black Lives Matter protests in Washington, DC, in June of 2020.\n\nAt least four of the kneelers were reassigned to positions widely viewed as demotions, according to the Washington Post.\n\nThe transferred agents previously held senior roles in counterintelligence, counterterrorism and cybercrimes, the outlet reported.\n\nThey were not given a reason for their transfers, according to the publication.\n\nThe decision by the agents to take a knee was viewed by some as necessary to de-escalate the demonstration - as several Floyd-related protests turned violent that summer - and by others as a political statement.\n\n\"Those agents were not ever trained to be in that situation,\" a former agent familiar with the matter told the Washington Post. \"Riot control is not our mission. We are trained to de-escalate.''\n\nThe FBI Agents Association reportedly rewarded the kneelers with $100 gift cards for their actions during the protest.\n\nFormer Rep. Matt Gaetz (R-Fla.) claimed in 2023 that he had learned some of the kneeling agents received \"plum personnel opportunities and promotions and advancements\" from the bureau.\n\n\"Many FBI personnel we were trusting to be on the front lines were photographed kneeling in surrender to people who at times were violent,\" Gaetz told Fox News at the time.\n\n\"To climb the ladder in federal employment, you shouldn't have to shimmy up the woke totem pole,\" he added, describing the behavior of the agents as \"demoralizing.\"\n\n\"The purpose of law enforcement is to keep people safe, not to engage in politics,\" Gaetz argued.\n\n\"And for the last several years, we've seen the FBI more interested in virtue signaling and political activity than in just the nuts and bolts in evaluating the facts and the law.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has reportedly moved to investigate, reassign and oust several senior FBI officials, including those involved in the raid of President Trump's Mar-a-Lago residence and the investigation of Jan. 6, 2021, Capitol riot participants.\n\nThe FBI declined to comment on personnel matters.\n\nOriginally published as FBI demotes agents who took a knee during Washington DC Black Lives Matter protests in 2020: report",

            "body": "Election day is nearly upon us and the polls seem pretty well set - after a surge in support Labor is leading the Coalition on the national vote 52-48 on average across major polls.\n\nBut privately both major parties think this contest will still be tight.\n\nSo where should you be looking on election night to know which way the contest is going?\n\nAs votes come in, keep an eye on what is happening to the primary vote of the two major parties.\n\nThe Coalition need an improvement from last election when 35.7 per cent of the national vote delivered them only 58 seats.\n\nFor Labor they barely managed majority government with 32.6 per cent of the vote - a likely change in preference flow this time around means they will need a higher vote if they are to avoid losing seats.\n\nDeep into this campaign, it's emerging that the further you go out in metropolitan areas, the bigger the swing will be.\n\nBut the problem for the Liberal Party is some of those outer urban areas also have bigger margins, with Melbourne a good example.\n\nWe will almost certainly see swings in McEwen (margin 3.8 per cent), Bruce (5.3 per cent), Dunkley (6.8 per cent), Hawke (7.6 per cent) and Gorton (10 per cent).\n\nIf they all fall it will be game on, but for every seat in which you see a decent swing to the Opposition (three per cent plus) without it changing hands, it's effectively wasted swing for the Coalition.\n\nThe Coalition's swing in several key seats could be enhanced by One Nation.\n\nThe party managed only five per cent at the last election, but current opinion polling has them getting up to 10 per cent.\n\nIt won't be enough to win any lower house seats, but the party does best in the outer suburbs meaning their vote there could be more like 15 per cent.\n\nIt could be enough perhaps to help tip several seats from Labor to Liberal.\n\nAnd in the senate, it could be enough to get One Nation an extra 3 senate positions, which would really shake-up the upper house.\n\nThe size of the crossbench will be crucial at this election, in particular for the Coalition.\n\nIt lost a staggering nine seats to Teals and Greens last time, and if can't claw any of them back, it makes it a very hard path back to government, because only a few of the MPs who ousted Liberals last time would give supply and confidence to Peter Dutton in a minority scenario.\n\nThere is the prospect of going backwards - with Climate 200 backing repeat candidates on close margins in Bradfield, Cowper, and Wannon.\n\nThat would be a hammer blow to the Opposition's overall chances.\n\nThe Coalition start this election 22 seats behind Labor, so like the Brisbane Lions' semi-final comeback from 44 points down, its job will be much easier if it doesn't let the Opposition have any wins.\n\nAny seats that go from blue to red will have extra significance on Saturday night.\n\nLabor is eyeing off seats in every state except WA (where it already has a stranglehold) so there is not one area to look for here, but it has half a dozen or so seats it feels it can genuinely win from the Liberal party.\n\nEven if only two to three of those actually fall, it will make the mountain too high to climb for the Opposition.\n\nBeware the early vote - the first votes that will come in on Saturday night will be small regional booths in Tasmania.\n\nIn 2022 some Labor insiders panicked when these booths showed no real swing - but of course it turned out the booths - and indeed Tasmania as a state - bucked the national trend.\n\nAnd equally beware the late vote - prepoll turnout is set to reach a new high, and these bigger booths take longer to count.\n\nThis means seats can fluctuate dramatically even late in to the night as big booths take longer to count, all adding to the drama as Australians wait to see who will form the next government after May 3.",
