            "title": "Sex assault reports in the U.S. military fell last year, fueled by a big drop in the Army",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- The number of sexual assaults reported across the U.S. military dipped by nearly 4% last year, fueled by a significant drop in the Army, according to a new Pentagon report. It was the second year in a row with a decrease, reversing a troubling trend that has plagued the Defense Department for more than a decade.\n\nSenior defense officials said that while the decline is a good sign, the number of reported assaults is still too high and the military needs to do more to get victims to report the often undisclosed crime.\n\nAccording to the report, there were 8,195 reported sexual assaults in 2024 involving members of the military, compared with 8,515 in 2023. In 2022, there were 8,942 reported sexual assaults, a spike that triggered widespread alarm and led to new programs and an infusion of funding to try to combat the problem.\n\nThe overall decrease was due to a 13% drop in reported sexual assaults across the Army, which is the largest military service.\n\nAll the other services saw increases. The Navy had the largest jump of 4.3%, while the Air Force had a 2.2% increase and the Marine Corps rose by less than 1%.\n\nOf the 8,195 total, there were 512 service members who reported an assault that happened before they entered the military. The Pentagon encourages reporting so that victims can get any support they need. In addition, 641 were civilians who said they were assaulted by a member of the military.\n\nSpeaking to reporters Thursday, Nate Galbreath, director of the Pentagon's sexual assault prevention and response office, said it's still not clear how the Trump administration's personnel and budget cuts will affect these programs. He said officials are asking for details on the number of assault prevention staff who have been laid off or who took any of the early retirement offers.\n\nAndra Tharp, director of the command climate office, added that \"when the hiring freeze went into effect, there were about 300 prevention workforce positions posted on USA jobs that are essentially on hold.\" But, she said, some departments have been able to get exemptions.\n\nGalbreath said the department also is now able to link sexual assaults to military readiness. He said a survey showed that service members who had experienced assault were more likely to leave the military, be demoted, miss a promotion or have some other type of negative action put in their files than those who hadn't been been victimized.\n\nHe said the survey followed troops who said in 2016 that they had experienced a sexual assault, and a group of others who did not.\n\nAs a result, he said the Defense Department is working to develop a recovery program to teach healthy coping skills and other assistance for victims. The department also has a Safe Helpline where troops can seek help.\n\nWhile reported assaults decreased, the number of sexual harassment complaints went from 2,980 in 2023 to 3,014 last year. Most were filed by female service members, and the vast majority of those accused were male.\n\nThe number of cases in which misconduct was substantiated increased a bit last year over the 2023 total. The number of discharges and administrative actions against alleged perpetrators continued to increase, and court-martial charges declined - both trends going back several years.\n\nOfficials noted that nearly three-quarters of the court-martial cases ended in convictions, a slight increase over the previous year.\n\nSexual assault reports in the military have gone up for much of the past decade, except for a tiny decrease in 2020, during the COVID-19 pandemic shutdown. Officials say they are optimistic about the recent decreases but say much more work needs to be done.\n\nAs in previous years, most sexual assault reports are filed by those between ages 18 and 24 and involve lower-ranking service members.\n\nWhile it is difficult to point to any one reason for the two-year decline, the Defense Department has been making a series of changes over the past year that officials say may be contributing.\n\nThe services were using more than $1 billion to improve programs and hire up to 2,500 personnel as part of a new \"prevention workforce\" and place them at military installations worldwide.\n\nSo far, about 1,400 have been hired, but that process has stalled due to the Trump administration's budget and personnel cuts across the federal government. Defense officials said they are working to spread the existing workers around to lessen the gaps until more can be hired.\n\nThe latest report also reflects the first full year since new prosecution procedures have been in place, putting independent lawyers in charge of those decisions and sidelining commanders after years of pressure from Congress.\n\nOfficials said it is too soon to tell what effect those changes are having on prosecutions.\n\nThe Pentagon releases a report every year on the number of sexual assaults reported by or about troops. But because sexual assault is a highly underreported crime, the department also does a confidential survey every two years to get a clearer picture of the problem. That online survey came out last year, so it was not done this year.\n\nLast year's survey said more than 29,000 active-duty service members said they had experienced unwanted sexual contact in the previous year, compared with nearly 36,000 in the 2021 survey, according to several defense officials. The decrease was the first in eight years.\n\nBut officials said the survey also indicates that a large number of service members never file a report.\n\nDefense officials have long argued that an increase in reported assaults is a positive trend because so many people are reluctant to report them, both in the military and in society as a whole. Greater reporting, they say, shows there is more confidence in the reporting system and greater comfort with the support for victims.",

            "title": "Nolte: Fox News Prime Time Attracts 5X More Viewers than CNNLOL in April",
            "body": "Throughout the month of April, Fox News primetime attracted five(!) times as many total viewers as far-left CNN.\n\nAs I have made clear since time began, I am no Fox News fan. So, I am not here championing Fox News. Cable news as a format is toxic to the human condition. Not watching the news, especially cable news, is like ceasing to hit yourself over the head with a hammer.\n\nStill ... LOL.\n\nThroughout all of April, the full month, CNN -- a left-wing propaganda outlet that traffics in conspiracy theories and spreads violence -- was only able to attract an average of 519,000 prime-time viewers. Fox News, however, attracted an average of 2.592 million prime-time viewers. Do that math and then throw your head back and laugh.\n\nIn the crucial 25-54 age demographic, CNN attracted a measly 99,000 viewers, while Fox News earned nearly three times as many: 296,000.\n\nThis is the age demo that sets advertising rates. In the age 25-54 demo category MSNBC attracted only 105,000 viewers.\n\nIn May, Fox News attracted an average of 264,000 primetime viewers in that key demographic. The last time their 25-54 ratings were so low for a single month was August of 2001, or just before the September 11th attacks. Although Fox News's individual shows continue to win out over their competitors, May produced decade-low numbers for their primetime and morning hosts, particularly in the 25-54 demographic used by advertisers. And that's why those figures matter so much: Fox News's audience is still relatively huge, but it's taking in smaller numbers of the only viewers ad buyers pay attention to.\n\nInverse in June of 2015: \"On Average, Fox News Viewers Are 68. How Long Before Their Average Is Dead?\"\n\nNew York Magazine in 2013: \"Only Old People Watch Fox News\"\n\nWhile the 25 to 54 group, a.k.a. the \"demos\" in TV-speak, is the most sought-after, Fox's bottom line has not been affected. Yet. A sort-of-revitalized CNN is gaining a bit in the ratings, while the \"downward trend in younger viewers seems to be accelerating at Fox News[.]\"\n\nFrank Rich in 2014:\n\nFox News is losing younger viewers at an even faster rate than its competitors. With a median viewer age now at 68 according to Nielsen data through mid-January (compared with 60 for MSNBC and CNN, and 62 to 64 for the broadcast networks), Fox is in essence a retirement community ... If it is actuarially possible, its median viewer age will keep creeping upward. (It rose by two years over the course of 2013.)\n\nRemember that? Remember how the fake media told us that the era of Fox News dominating the cable news ratings would come to an end as soon as their old-ass viewers died off? Are these liars ever right about anything? Remember, these are the same people who assure us we need to become communists to stop Global Warming.\n\nHere the raw numbers for the month of April -- suck on it, CNN...\n\n\"Compared to March, CNN was down -12% in total viewers and -18% in the demo during primetime,\" reported AdWeek. \"Across total day, it dropped -5% in total viewers and -13% in the demo.\" [sic]\n\n\"Relative to April 2024, CNN was down -17% in total viewers and -12% in the demo. In total day, CNN saw respective declines of -19% and -23% in those categories.\" [sic]\n\nFox News saw even bigger dips compared to March, but compared to last year, \"the network was up by +31% in total viewers and +35% in the demo. In total day, it was up a respective +28% and +29% in those categories.\" [sic]\n\nBut-but-but you told me ten years ago Fox News viewers would all be dead. HAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA *deep breath* HAHAHAHAHAHA...",

            "title": "Opinion | The F Word Won't Save Democrats",
            "body": "You're reading the Frank Bruni newsletter, for Times subscribers only. Reflections on the mess (and magic) of politics and life. Get it with a Times subscription.\n\nOne of the few occasions recently when I felt confidence in Democrats' ability to counter Donald Trump was Senator Elissa Slotkin's response to his address to a joint session of Congress in early March. After Trump bloviated for 100 minutes, Slotkin talked plainly for about 10.\n\nShe kept it simple. The president, she said, was failing on three crucial fronts -- the economy, national security and democracy. She presented the evidence. Suggested alternatives. Said good night.\n\nThat was all. And that was enough -- a rejection of hooey and histrionics that underscored the Trump administration's surfeit of both.\n\nBut in the DNA of every Democrat lurks the temptation to overthink and overcomplicate things, and Slotkin last week succumbed to it.\n\nIn an interview with Politico that previewed what she called her \"war plan\" for her party, she proclaimed that Democrats must no longer be \"weak and woke.\" I take her point. I question her alliteration. Contrived slogans don't say: I'm getting strong and real. They say: I've got consultants and the time for semantic noodling.\n\nSlotkin also confused plain-spokenness and profanity, dropping the F bomb at the start of an exhortation that her party \"retake the flag.\" That wasn't the end of her expletives. I suppose she was going for earthiness, but that's hardly a proxy for worthiness. It felt gimmicky -- the exact opposite of her March remarks.\n\nThose remarks were pitched directly to voters. But now she's taking aim at fellow Democrats. In her view, the Fighting Oligarchy tour starring Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez channels the right rage with the wrong vocabulary: How many Americans know an oligarch from a plutocrat from a kleptocrat from some other polysyllabic jerk?\n\n\"Well, jeez,\" Sanders retorted during an appearance days later on the NBC News show \"Meet the Press.\" \"We had 36,000 people out in Los Angeles, 34,000 people in Colorado. We had 30,000 people in Folsom, Calif., which is kind of a rural area. I think the American people are not quite as dumb as Ms. Slotkin thinks they are.\"\n\nThey're certainly smarter than Democratic politicians, who aren't slouching towards Bethlehem but squabbling towards oblivion.\n\nIt makes no sense for Slotkin to be sniping at anyone in her party who is mobilizing voters as effectively as Sanders and Ocasio-Cortez are. It serves no purpose for Sanders to respond snottily to Slotkin. We're sprinting towards autocracy; egos and acrimony have no place in the opposition to that. The F word, the O word -- my word! What pointless distractions.\n\nEqually foolish are the plans by the political activist David Hogg, who is the vice chair of the Democratic National Committee, to funnel millions to Democratic candidates who wage primary challenges in 2026 against party incumbents. That makes the story about Democrat versus Democrat. It must be solely and solidly about Democrats versus Trump.\n\nWhy are they struggling so mightily with the messaging for that battle? I understand their paralysis about what to do in the face of Trump's assaults on economic logic, important alliances, civil liberties, congressional oversight, the separation of powers: They hold few levers beyond lawsuits.\n\nBut what to say isn't that hard. Slotkin herself demonstrated as much in March.\n\nDirect voters, in unadorned language, to how Trump is governing. And ask them earnestly if they're really OK with it.\n\nTime and again, over and over, recall that he pledged to lower prices and improve Americans' financial lots -- to usher in a whole new golden age of wealth. Then encourage random acts of arithmetic: Are they richer since Trump's election? Do tariff roulette and the stock market roller coaster persuade them that they will be? The questions answer themselves.\n\nMention Elon Musk. Then mention him a dozen more times. Don't worry about what to call him -- oligarch, obnoxious -- and dwell instead on his deeds, which haven't so much put the federal government on a diet as starved the country of the support necessary to stay ahead in medicine, in technological innovation, in higher education, in all the endeavors that made us the affluent envy of the world.\n\nBring up Pete Hegseth and the mess around him, which exemplifies a broader chaos. The way I read the latest polling, some voters who wagered on Trump's rashness as the handmaiden to bold change are realizing that it's kissing cousins with incompetence. Affirm that epiphany. No expletives required.\n\nDraw attention to the children who've been deported despite being U.S. citizens, to the Tufts student snatched from the street, to the immigrants banished to a hellhole in El Salvador without adequate cause or appropriate legal review. Call this by its name: sadism. Wonder aloud if Americans are comfortable with such cruelty. And if maybe, just maybe, they experience a twitch of fear when they contemplate where all of this could lead.\n\nThe discussion among and about Democrats who are trying to stop Trump from ravaging this country casts the formulation of a strategy as more challenging than it needs to be -- as an operation whose success depends on perfectly chosen emissaries and a perfectly honed script. It mistakes the urgency of the mission for the difficulty of it.\n\nChart Trump's excesses and sloppiness. He has taken false steps aplenty, and there will, scarily, be many more where those came from. He can't help himself. That will help Democrats mightily.\n\nMeasure the damage. It's profound. Note that there are better ways to govern. Lay them out succinctly, with an awareness of voters' limited attention, an absence of partisan jargon and an abundance of common sense.\n\nWorry later about which leaders from which wing of the party will use which tools to pick up the pieces. All that matters now is hurrying to that point.\n\nFor the Love of Sentences\n\nI exiled Trump talk from this section of my previous newsletter, on April 17. So I'll begin with it this time.\n\nIn USA Today, Rex Huppke pondered the president's rambling reverie about \"an old-fashioned term that we use -- groceries\" and his definition of it as \"a bag with different things in it.\" \"Jiminy Crickets,\" Huppke wrote, \"the cheese has slid so far off this guy's cracker that it hit the floor and the dog ate it.\" (Thanks to Martin B. Copenhaver of Woodstock, Vt., and Frank W. Leonard of Seattle for flagging this.)\n\nIn The Dispatch, Kevin D. Williamson marveled at Trump's \"delicate little ego, which is always balanced precipitously on the brink of disaster like the scoop atop a wobbly toddler's ice cream cone in July.\" (Michael Smith, Georgetown, Ky.)\n\nIn The New Yorker, Jill Lepore surveyed the destruction of the past three months: \"Trump felled so much timber not because of the mightiness of his ax but because of the rot within the trees and the weakness of the wood.\" (Stan Shatenstein, Montreal)\n\nIn The Washington Post, Ron Charles weighed in: \"Trump's tariffs, like Schr\u00f6dinger's cat, are simultaneously dead and alive. But that's hardly a fair comparison. Quantum mechanics is so much easier to understand than the whims and rages of the elderly golf enthusiast who sometimes pops by the White House to savage Americans' retirement savings.\" (Maria Wulff, Portland, Ore., and Terry Grant, McGregor, Texas, among others)\n\nAlso in The Washington Post, David Von Drehle got the jitters from Elon Musk: \"Like a lot of eccentric rich guys in history, the middle-aged Musk could be leaking radiator fluid on the highway of life.\" Also, regarding Musk's and his brethren's grandiose alarmism: \"Tech bros fancy apocalypses the way 6-year-old girls fancy unicorns.\" (Gary Brauch, Los Altos Hills, Calif.)\n\nIn his newsletter, No Mercy/No Malice, Scott Galloway reviewed Trump's driving skills: \"A blackout drunk is behind the wheel of the U.S. economy. All around us, horns (bear markets; consumer confidence plummeting to historic lows) are blaring. In the back seat is a cultist (G.O.P.) who thinks the red lights Trump has blown through, and the accidents in his wake, are baller moves. Also in the back seat: a sulking teen (Democrats) who's visibly upset but can't articulate what they want or suggest a better route. Riding shotgun, though, is an adult the driver can't ignore, the bond market.\" (Steve Carmine, Centennial, Colo.)\n\nIn The Atlantic, Quinta Jurecic acknowledged Americans' apprehensions that Trump might at some point defy an order from the Supreme Court: \"Ultimately, asking what would happen in such a circumstance is like consulting the Monopoly rule book for instructions about what to do if somebody flips over the board.\" (Jeanne Sturges, Peterborough, N.H., and Kate Longaker, Atlanta, among others)\n\nAlso in The Atlantic, Helen Lewis chronicled the hubbub after the writer Douglas Murray used an appearance on \"The Joe Rogan Experience\" to challenge Rogan's offering a platform to conspiracy theorists: \"The podcast world has experienced levels of sniping that make the 'Real Housewives' franchise look like the Bretton Woods conference.\" (Tom Williford, Marshall, Minn., and Eric L. Johnson, Chapel Hill, N.C.)\n\nIn The Guardian, Arwa Mahdawi mined the significance of Gwyneth Paltrow's reintroduction of low-cost starches to her diet: \"Perhaps they are a subtle recession indicator? With Trump's tariffs poised to make everything more expensive, I cannoli imagine that we're going to see a lot of people cutting back on meat and eating more pasta.\" (Gail Smith, Wilmington, Del.)\n\nIn her newsletter, Fresh Hell, Tina Brown reacted to an invitation from someone decades younger than she: \"A friend of mine in her 40s hosted a birthday party last week at New York's most glamorous new club with the dress code of 'drop-dead sexy,' which gave me a burst of insecurity. People in my circle are very good at 'drop dead.' Sexy, not so much.\" (Rich Moche, Brookline, Mass.)\n\nIn The Times, Sapna Maheshwari examined how many college athletes like Jake Dailey are pitched on, and tempted by, lucrative social-media opportunities: \"Mr. Dailey, who has 90,000 TikTok followers and 32,000 on Instagram, said he would be thrilled to become a full-time influencer. Otherwise, he plans to become a dentist.\" (Charles Kelley, Merrimack, N.H.)\n\nAnd in The Washington Post, Sebastian Smee appraised an exhibition at Boston's Museum of Fine Arts: \"It is devoted to Vincent van Gogh's portraits of a single family. I came out of it with a full heart not so much warmed as wobbly and exposed, like a freshly shucked oyster.\" (Brad Niebling, Pebble Beach, Calif.)\n\nTo nominate favorite bits of recent writing from The Times or other publications to be mentioned in \"For the Love of Sentences,\" please email me here and include your name and place of residence.\n\nWhat I'm Writing, Reading and Doing\n\nIn another life I wrote extensively about religion -- especially the Roman Catholic Church -- and even for a few years covered the Vatican. So I had thoughts aplenty about Pope Francis' legacy, and I collected some of them in this guest essay in The Times about his statements and positions regarding gay people.\n\nMy latest book, \"The Age of Grievance,\" about the indiscriminate rage that's corrupting American politics and corroding America itself, will be released in paperback on May 13. This revised edition takes into account the 2024 election results and notes how much the national conversation about Luigi Mangione said about who we are today.\n\nDuring my time at The Times, I've been blessed with superb editors. Among the sharpest and kindest was Honor Jones, who is now (drats!) at The Atlantic and has written an enormously moving first novel, \"Sleep,\" which will be published on May 13. The story of a young mother coming to terms with her own mother's failures, it's a testament to Honor's ear for language, gentle touch and deep wisdom.\n\nOn May 27 in Chapel Hill, N.C., I'll be interviewing the historian Molly Worthen about her exciting new book, \"Spellbound: How Charisma Shaped American History From the Puritans to Donald Trump.\" Details are here.\n\nOn May 29 in Asheville, N.C., I'll be interviewed onstage about \"The Age of Grievance\" and more by Tom Fiedler, the former executive editor of The Miami Herald and the former dean of journalism at Boston University's College of Communication. Details are here.\n\nOn a Personal (by Which I Mean Regan) Note\n\nI hugely appreciate the emails from many of you asking about Regan's healing from her knee surgery in November. I'm happy to report that she has finally completed what seems to be a full recovery.\n\nJust in time to surrender to old age and to sputter for that reason.\n\nMy furry beloved always had a lazy streak -- she always balanced or contradicted our 90-minute or two-hour walks with occasions when she hopped onto the bed at 8 p.m. and didn't leave it until 2 p.m. the next day. But I'm telling you, this is different.\n\nShe sleeps harder than ever. She moves less. Even if she has had just a 40-minute walk in the early morning, she'll sometimes decline a second outing in the late afternoon. She wants to loll on the front stoop instead. It's not that she's in any distress; trust me, I know her. It's just that she's 11 years old.\n\nAnd I find her more endearing than ever.\n\nI always wondered if, when she slowed down, I'd mourn the Regan who bolted so reliably after squirrels and deer, who made so many deviations and digressions on a woodland walk that she logged thrice the miles I did, who was such an athletic wonder to behold.\n\nBut no. Her tamer tics amuse me in new ways. She seems to remember the weeks, just after that surgery, when I carried her upstairs, and now, on one of every three nights, she ascends the steps at a sloth's pace, pausing repeatedly to look back at me and see if maybe I'd like to pick her up and save her the effort. I nudge her along, less for my back than for her conditioning. She has to use those muscles lest she lose those muscles.\n\nHer hard sleeping means hard dreaming: She chirps, moans and murmurs, unconsciously narrating her adventures. She also does more phantom running than she used to; her paws drum my side. Ours is an increasingly percussive partnership, its beat evolving, its beauty enduring.",

            "body": "Defense Secretary Pete Hegseth laid out a plan of action for reinstating servicemembers who were forced out of the military by former President Biden's COVID vaccine mandate.\n\nDefense Secretary Pete Hegseth on Wednesday ordered a top-down transformation of the Army in a sweeping directive aimed at reorienting the service toward great power competition.\n\nWith a sharp focus on countering China, developing space and counter-space capabilities, and accelerating the Pentagon's new Golden Dome strategy, the aggressive modernization effort directs the Army to cut aging legacy systems, restructure headquarters commands and more rapidly field new technologies.\n\nThe memo ordered a merging of Army Futures Command, based in Austin, Texas, with Training and Doctrine Command, headquartered in Fort Eustis, Virginia, and merging Forces Command, U.S. Army North and U.S. Army South.\n\n\"To build a leaner, more lethal force, the Army must transform at an accelerated pace by divesting outdated, redundant, and inefficient programs, as well as restructuring headquarters and acquisition systems,\" Hegseth wrote.\n\nNEW ARMY SECRETARY PRAISES TRUMP, HEGSETH FOR CREATING 'A LANE FOR CHANGE' AS HE ZEROES IN ON CUTTING WASTE\n\n\"Simultaneously, the Army must prioritize investments in accordance with the Administration's strategy, ensuring existing resources are prioritized to improve long-range precision fires, air and missile defense including through the Golden Dome for America, cyber, electronic warfare, and counter-space capabilities.\"\n\nHegseth wants the Army to be able to field long-range missiles capable of striking moving land and sea targets and achieve electromagnetic and air-littoral dominance by 2027 as the potential for conflict looms in the Indo-Pacific theater.\n\nThe memo calls for reducing manned attack helicopter formations in favor of inexpensive drone swarms and the reduction of general officer positions to focus command structures on the warfighter.\n\nHEGSETH SENDS STRONG MESSAGE TO IRAN AND HOUTHIS: 'YOU WILL PAY'\n\nHegseth ordered the Army to enable AI-driven command and control at theater, corps and division headquarters by 2027 and expand 3D printing for weapons.\n\nThe memo also calls for bulking up the Army's presence in the Indo-Pacific and more joint exercises with allies in the region.\n\nThe procurement of obsolete systems will be ended, per the memo, and \"redundant or ineffective\" programs will be canceled or scaled back, including manned aircraft and excess ground vehicles like the Humvee.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nThe Army will review and cancel inefficient contracts and work to shift from program-centric funding to capability-based funding, and add right to repair provisions in all contracts, as well as implement performance-based contracting to reduce waste.\n\nThe defense secretary also calls for reforms to hiring and firing systems, and reduced spending on climate initiatives, legacy sustainment initiatives and excess travel.",

            "body": "One of my great amusements in life is watching and listening to the Democrats when they've lost an election. It is usually the same story, but it's more pronounced now with Donald Trump as president. We are going to hear the following for the next year-and-a-half or so before the midterms: Trump is a dictator, Nazi, fascist and bully, among other things.\n\nThe mainstream press will join in, of course. They will say Trump is only for the rich and does not care about the rest of the population. And then they are going to divide people by talking about white privilege and how whites want to prevent minorities from voting. They'll say Trump and his supporters want to gather up Black people, put them in chains and send them to Africa. They will also try to bribe voters, like they did when Joe Biden tried to forgive student loans.\n\nThe Democrats lost the presidential election in 2024 for a very simple reason: In Biden, we had by far the worst human being and president we have ever had. Then we had a joke of a candidate in Harris. Added to that, people are tired of the woke agenda, including the sky-is-falling climate change propaganda, open borders and endless wars, to name just a few. The Democrats will always blame others and say the American people are too stupid to understand their agenda. But Americans do understand the Democrats' agenda -- and they've rejected it.\n\nThe Democrats will never accept that they're the reason they lost this election and they'll never change. Hopefully the wimpy Republicans will take this opportunity to come up with and implement a sane agenda after four years of insanity and chaos under Biden.",
