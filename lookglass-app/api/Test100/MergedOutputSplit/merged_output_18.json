            "body": "The \"Prepper Bar,\" a perforated precious metal bar, offers a novel solution for divisibility and portability, addressing the challenge of using metals for smaller transactions. This innovation underscores the growing trend of seeking tangible assets for financial security in uncertain times.\n\nIndividuals might find it prudent to reassess their banking practices in light of several converging factors: the diminishing value of savings due to inflation, the looming threat of bank failures reminiscent of past crises and the intrinsic vulnerabilities of the fractional reserve banking system. This is not just about moving money; it's about safeguarding wealth in an era of unprecedented economic challenges.\n\nThe first concern is the insidious effect of inflation on the purchasing power of money. Consider this: if you had left $1 million in a bank account since 1913, its value would have dwindled to a mere $40,000 by 2024. This staggering loss of purchasing power is a direct result of inflation, a phenomenon that has consistently outpaced the interest rates offered by traditional savings accounts.\n\nThis is not a new problem. Historically, periods of high inflation have often coincided with economic turmoil, such as the stagflation of the 1970s. However, the current economic climate, marked by unprecedented monetary stimulus and supply chain disruptions, has exacerbated the situation. The Federal Reserve's recent pivot towards higher interest rates may offer some respite, but the damage to savings has already been done.\n\nThe second, more immediate fear is the possibility of another wave of bank closures. The 2023 banking crisis, which saw the collapse of several regional banks, serves as a stark reminder of the vulnerabilities within the financial system. Even if your bank remains open, the ability to access your funds is not guaranteed.\n\nWhile banks are legally obligated to return depositors' funds, the practicalities of doing so can be fraught with obstacles. The Dodd-Frank Act, enacted in the wake of the 2008 financial crisis, imposed stricter regulations on banks, but it also introduced measures that could restrict access to funds during a crisis.\n\nFinancial advisors also highlight the mechanics of fractional reserve banking, a system where banks are required to hold only a fraction of their deposits in reserve. This means that the money you deposit is often lent out to other customers, sometimes up to nine or ten times over. While this practice fuels economic growth, it also means that in the event of a bank run, the bank may not have sufficient liquidity to meet withdrawal demands.\n\nThis is not a hypothetical scenario. The 2008 financial crisis saw a similar dynamic play out, with banks teetering on the brink of insolvency as panicked depositors rushed to withdraw their funds. The subsequent bailouts by the government highlighted the interconnectedness of the financial system and the potential for systemic risk.\n\nIn light of these risks, many think a strategic shift in how individuals manage their finances is in order. The first step is to withdraw excess funds from traditional bank accounts. But where should this money go? The answer lies in alternative investments, particularly precious metals like gold and silver.\n\nPrecious metals have historical resillience, and have \"stood the test of time back to the Bible times as being the best store of wealth to weather out a storm in the economy.\" This is not just anecdotal evidence. Central banks around the world have been accumulating gold at an unprecedented rate, a clear indication of their confidence in its value.\n\nMoreover, the tax advantages of holding gold and silver in an IRA (Investment Retirement Account), a strategy that aligns with the principle of minimizing tax liabilities. This approach is not just about preserving wealth; it's about optimizing it in a way that aligns with long-term financial goals.\n\nIn addition to traditional bullion and coins, a new product that has caused a stir in the precious metals industry: the Prepper Bar.\n\nThis innovative bar, available in both silver and gold, is perforated to allow for easy breaking into smaller, tradeable pieces. This feature addresses a common challenge with precious metals: their lack of divisibility. The Prepper Bar offers a practical solution for those who need to use their wealth in smaller, more manageable increments.\n\nIn conclusion, the consensus is clear: the time to act is now. The financial landscape is fraught with risks, from the devaluation of the dollar to the potential for bank closures.\n\nBy diversifying into precious metals and exploring alternative investment vehicles like the Genesis Gold IRA, individuals can protect their wealth and ensure their financial security in an uncertain world.",

            "body": "Readers respond to an article on consumer frustrations with recycling used clothing\n\nRe your article ('You sold it - now recycle it': the protesters mailing worn-out clothes to the shops they bought them from, 29 April), a significant percentage of the used-clothing waste stream consists of plastic zips and buttons, nylon ribbons and mile upon mile of polyester sewing thread, which will still be plastic even when it breaks up into microfibre. This is all devastating to wildlife, on land or sea.\n\nIncineration plants are used to dispose of much of this modern clothing trash, but they come with a bad track record. Furthermore, the petrochemical industry saw disinvestment from fossil fuel on the horizon decades ago, so its promoters headed towards every other business that could use it, resulting in a huge move towards plastic packaging and manmade textiles, even though it would lead to industrial-scale pollution.\n\nIt would be useful for articles to progress from shoppers' difficulties in making eco-friendly choices to compare clothing manufactured from natural materials. These do incur an environmental cost, but should be easier to dispose of, except that the fibre must be unblended, stitching must be cotton or linen, and the final garment unadorned with manmade features such as fasteners, care labels, and embroidered logos.\n\nThe social cost of our clothing must also be reckoned with. Sweatshops and child labour are involved in the processing of cotton. The supply chain is global and difficult to trace. There are healthier ways to stock our wardrobes and it would be a positive contribution if the Guardian could write about more that aren't cripplingly expensive.\n\nJane Eades\n\nTruro, Cornwall\n\nI started mailing plastic packaging to CEOs and MPs in 2007 to highlight frustration at having plastic imposed on consumers and then paying in our council tax to landfill or incinerate it, both of which produce toxic residue. The \"polluter pays\" policy doesn't seem to apply to retailers, who blame manufacturers while extolling the virtues of plastic for keeping food undamaged as it gathers food miles.\n\nI've bought most of my clothing secondhand all my life, but charity shop textiles have gone downhill. Even the new stuff is unwearable. I am reminded of Brentford Nylons in th 1970s - sweaty bedsheets, gaudy patterns and static shocks. I now buy better-quality, natural textiles that last, and I mend what I can for as long as I can. In times past, two sets of clothes sufficed and were left in your will. That does sound extreme, but maybe we should start by simply consuming less while finding new ways to repurpose material.\n\nHelen McDowall\n\nBampton, Devon\n\nWhile I take the point that shops shouldn't sell this stuff, I can't help think that it is also down to consumers to take responsibility. Shops sell what people want to buy. For all those sending clothes back in outrage, it would be interesting to know how many other synthetic items they've purchased since the offending item. There are many natural material choices available that can be easily recycled if you check the label before purchasing.\n\nBuy a cotton sheet, not polycotton. Denim without elastic is available if you go for non-stretch versions. Maybe if people favoured natural fabrics with their purchasing power, and bought less in the first place, it would be less of a problem.\n\nEllie Clarke\n\nLondon",

            "title": "Prosecutors in Thailand say they won't pursue royal defamation case against U.S. scholar",
            "body": "BANGKOK -- State prosecutors in Thailand announced Thursday that they don't intend to press charges against an American academic arrested for royal defamation, an offense punishable by up to 15 years in prison.\n\nThe arrest last month of Paul Chambers, a political science lecturer at Naresuan University in the northern province of Phitsanulok, had drawn concern from the academic community, especially from Asian studies scholars around the world, as well as the U.S. government\n\nThe decision not to prosecute the 58-year-old Oklahoma native doesn't immediately clear him of the charge of insulting the monarchy- also known as \"l\u00e8se majest\u00e9\" - or a related charge of violating the Computer Crime Act, which covers online activities.\n\nThe announcement said that the Phitsanulok provincial prosecutor will request the provincial court to drop the charges and forward the case file and nonprosecution order to the commissioner of Provincial Police Region 6, covering Phitsanulok, who may review and contest the decision.\n\nChambers, a 58-year-old Oklahoma native with a doctorate in political science from Northern Illinois University, was arrested in early April on a complaint made by the northern regional office of the army's Internal Security Operations Command.\n\nHe has studied the power and influence of the Thai military, which plays a major role in politics. It has staged 13 coups since Thailand became a constitutional monarchy in 1932, most recently 11 years ago.\n\nThe army's Internal Security Operations Command told a parliamentary inquiry that it filed the complaint based on a Facebook post that translated words from a website operated by ISEAS-Yusof Ishak Institute, a think tank in Singapore, about a webinar on Thai politics that included Chambers as a participant.\n\nChambers' supporters said that the blurb for the webinar, which was cited in his charge sheet as evidence, wasn't written by him.\n\nHe had been jailed in April for two nights after reporting himself to the Phitsanulok police, and then granted release on bail, with several conditions, including wearing an ankle monitor. A court on Tuesday allowed him to take off the device.\n\nChambers' visa was revoked at the time of his arrest on the basis of an immigration law barring entry to foreigners who are deemed likely to engage in activities contrary to public order or good morals, prostitution, people smuggling and drug trafficking. It wasn't immediately clear whether the revocation will stand.\n\n\"This case reinforces our longstanding concerns about the use of l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 laws in Thailand,\" a U.S. State Department statement said after Chambers' arrest. \"We continue to urge Thai authorities to respect freedom of expression and to ensure that laws are not used to stifle permitted expression.\"\n\nThailand's l\u00e8se majest\u00e9 law calls for three to 15 years imprisonment for anyone who defames, insults or threatens the king, the queen, the heir apparent or the regent. Critics say it's among the harshest such laws anywhere and also has been used to punish critics of the government and the military.\n\nThe monarchy has long been considered a pillar of Thai society and criticizing it used to be strictly taboo. Conservative Thais, especially in the military and courts, still consider it untouchable.\n\nHowever, public debate on the topic has grown louder in the past decade, particularly among young people, and student-led pro-democracy protests starting in 2020 began openly criticizing the institution.\n\nThat led to vigorous prosecutions under the previously little-used law. The legal aid group Thai Lawyers for Human Rights has said that since early 2020, more than 270 people - many of them student activists - have been charged with violating the law.",

Lou Correa and George Whitesides.\n\nOther Democrats in the number include Reps. Bennie Thompson, D-Miss., Pat Ryan, D-N.Y., Tom Suozzi, D-N.Y., Jared Moskowitz, D-Fla., Hillary Scholten, D-Mich., and Frank Mrvan, D-Ind.\n\nKAMALA HARRIS REVEALS TIMETABLE FOR MAKING MAJOR POLITICAL DECISION IN DEEP BLUE STATE\n\nIt was a stunning repudiation of their own former party leader's policies targeting one of Democrats' largest strongholds.\n\nRepublican leaders, meanwhile, cheered the resolution's passage.\n\nHouse Majority Leader Steve Scalise, R-La., said of the California waiver, \"This radical measure bans the sale of gas-powered vehicles, forcing electric vehicles on the American people and taking away consumer choice.\"\n\n\"Americans should choose which car best suits their needs and the needs of their family, not the government,\" Scalise told Fox News Digital.\n\nHouse Majority Whip Tom Emmer, R-Minn., said, \"There is no reason the radical climate policies of California should regulate the entire American population and rob every American of consumer choice.\"\n\n\"House Republicans are righting yet another wrong done by the Biden administration and returning basic freedom to choose whatever car you want to the American people,\" Emmer told Fox News Digital.\n\nHHS DOWNSIZING BEGINS AMID RFK JR. 'MAKE AMERICA HEALTHY AGAIN' PUSH: 'WIN-WIN FOR TAXPAYERS'\n\nRep. John Joyce, R-Pa., vice chairman of the House Energy & Commerce Committee, introduced a resolution of disapproval last month targeting a Biden administration-era waiver granted to California that would help the state realize its goal of a full ban on the sale of new gas cars by 2035.\n\nA resolution of disapproval, under the Congressional Review Act, allows lawmakers a mechanism to oppose unilateral rules made by federal agencies.\n\nBiden's EPA approved a waiver for California in December 2024, just over a month before he left office, that would make it possible for the state to phase out new gas-powered car sales by 2035.\n\nThe waiver was granted despite concerns raised by major automakers earlier that year about the feasibility of California's goals - but state officials pushing the plan have insisted it was critical to take on climate change.\n\nAt the time, the Biden administration argued the waiver amounted to an order rather than a regulatory rule, meaning it would not be subject to congressional review.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\nHowever, it has been the subject of a standoff between the Trump administration and the federal bureaucracy since then.\n\nThe Trump administration asked Congress to review the waiver in late February of this year - paving the way for a potential repeal under the GOP-controlled House and Senate.\n\nHowever, the Government Accountability Office said in March that California's waiver is not subject to the Congressional Review Act.",

            "title": "When Trump's Immigration Crackdown Came to Yemi Mobolade's City",
            "body": "Shattered glass and spilled beer coated the floors of the nightclub. More than 100 people had been taken into custody by federal immigration agents, and Colorado Springs's mayor, Yemi Mobolade, had a decision to make.\n\nLaw enforcement officials said their operation in the Sunday morning darkness cleared out a club that was rife with drugs, guns and prostitution. Liberal voters who helped elect Mr. Mobolade, a Nigerian-born pastor and political independent, to lead their historically conservative city were disturbed by the mass arrest of so many immigrants.\n\nMr. Mobolade made his choice.\n\n\"This immigrant mayor says, if you're here illegally and you're committing a crime, there should be consequences,\" he said in an interview. \"You should be deported.\"\n\nThe raid, led by the Drug Enforcement Administration, came the week after a large-scale operation in Florida that led to the arrests of more than 1,100 people. But this one was conducted in Democratic Colorado, in an increasingly purple city, Colorado's second largest. The aftermath of the raid reflects the deep divisions over President Trump's mass deportation efforts.\n\nMr. Mobolade and other mayors in Colorado, New York and Massachusetts have faced frustration and criticism from voters over their response to record-breaking migrant arrivals under President Joseph R. Biden Jr. Now they face a backlash from the left, as the Trump administration steps up its immigration crackdown and presses local officials to cooperate.\n\nSome of Mr. Mobolade's left-leaning voters felt betrayed by the raid. The arrests and a lack of information about what had become of the detainees unnerved many immigrants. What's more, the city of Colorado Springs had participated by sending about 50 police officers to assist federal agents.\n\nOn Tuesday, about 30 people protested outside the local sheriff's office, waving banners that condemned Immigration and Customs Enforcement and shouting, \"Immigrants are welcome here!\"\n\n\"These raids are not about public safety,\" said Brandon Rincon, an organizer with the Colorado Springs Peoples Coalition. \"These are terror attacks on our community.\"\n\nBut Mr. Mobolade, who first came to the United States on a student visa, said he saw a clear difference between immigrants who came to the United States to work and the people who were scooped up and put on buses Sunday.\n\n\"I know there's a bigger immigration story going on, but this is about criminal behavior,\" he said.\n\nMr. Mobolade's election as mayor in 2023 captured the changing character of Colorado Springs, a city of 490,000 at the base of Pikes Peak, where large military bases and the headquarters of the Christian conservative organization Focus on the Family helped forge a culture on the political right.\n\nAn influx of liberal and moderate voters who have been priced out of Denver and Boulder has nudged the city toward the center, while the rest of Colorado has moved sharply left. Mr. Mobolade, a political newcomer, beat an establishment Republican to become the first Black mayor of a city whose population is roughly two-thirds white, and its first non-Republican mayor in more than 40 years.\n\nHis winning message: unity.\n\nStill, the 46-year-old mayor has found it hard to escape the country's culture wars, as he tried to help Colorado Springs recover from a 2022 mass shooting at an L.G.B.T.Q. nightclub, and to focus on bread-and-butter issues such as reducing homelessness and keeping the U.S. Space Command headquarters in town.\n\nMr. Trump's political comeback has had an impact. Mr. Mobolade said he had stopped describing the city as \"inclusive\" because of the battles over diversity, equity and inclusion. In the interview in his sixth-floor office, between meetings on public safety and summertime parks events, he wondered whether it was now polarizing even to call his city \"welcoming.\"\n\n\"We're forced to deal with the national chaos and conversation around identity politics,\" he said.\n\nSome neighbors living near the raided nightclub praised law enforcement for helping to clean up what they called a rough corner of town. Several of them called the D.E.A.'s Denver field office to leave grateful voice mail messages, officials said. \"Does my heart good to know somebody's looking after my safety,\" one man is heard to say.\n\nJonathan Pullen, the special agent in charge of the D.E.A.'s Rocky Mountain Field Division, described the nightclub, known as Warike, as a \"den of iniquity.\" It opened at 2 a.m. on weekends and drew a largely Latino clientele who learned of the club through Spanish-language posts on social media and word of mouth.\n\n\"Everything about it is illegal,\" Mr. Pullen said in an interview.\n\nAt the time of the raid, the club was operating in a mostly vacant strip mall, near a Mexican restaurant and a Hispanic market. The club had bounced from location to location, law enforcement officers said. A man who appeared to be the club's landlord declined on Thursday to comment, and the club's management could not be reached.\n\nThe D.E.A. began investigating the club earlier this year, and determined through undercover operations and surveillance that dealers inside were selling drugs. The raid found meth and a pink-dyed recreational drug known as tusi that often contains a mix of ketamine and other drugs, officials said. In mid-April, agents saw two patrons pointing guns out of their car windows and shooting into the air as they drove around outside the club, Mr. Pullen said.\n\nEarly on Sunday, agents from the D.E.A. and 10 other federal agencies surrounded the building and issued a bilingual order for the roughly 200 people inside to come out with their hands up. Photos and video posted online by the D.E.A. show patrons in sheer shirts, high-heel boots, and in one case a hot-pink suit, surrendering to agents in helmets and tactical vests.\n\nFederal officials said they had detained 114 people from countries including Mexico, Cuba, El Salvador and Venezuela. An ICE spokesman did not respond to a message asking how many of the detainees remained in custody on Thursday, or whether they would face deportation proceedings.\n\nMr. Pullen said the raid was primarily part of a drug investigation, not an immigration raid, and that the investigation was continuing. But he said federal agents had a duty to apprehend undocumented immigrants when they encountered them during an investigation.\n\n\"We didn't ask these illegal immigrants to come to this club,\" he said. \"They want to be involved where criminality is involved? Then this is the result.\"\n\nFederal agents detained 17 active-duty members of the U.S. military inside the club. Some of them had been working there as armed security, officials said. The service members were handed over to the Army's criminal investigations division.\n\nOn Thursday, the F.B.I. announced what appear to be the first criminal charges stemming from the raid, with the arrest of a soldier based at Fort Carson on charges of cocaine distribution.\n\nThe Colorado Springs police said two people caught up in the raid were arrested on outstanding warrants.\n\nSome people in Colorado Springs questioned why more than 100 immigrants were detained during the raid while most other patrons had been allowed to go home.\n\n\"They just went to a party,\" said Sarah Myers, the daughter of an undocumented Mexican father, who joined the protest criticizing the raid. \"Now their family doesn't know where they are.\"\n\nThe Colorado Springs officers who assisted in the raid largely stayed on the edges to secure the area, according to Adrian Vasquez, the city's police chief. He said city officers were not involved in detaining anyone on immigration charges.\n\nLast year, Colorado Springs passed a resolution declaring that it is not a sanctuary city. Even so, the police are bound by state laws that limit how law enforcement can cooperate with federal immigration agents.\n\nAbout 20 percent of Colorado Springs residents are Latino, and the city celebrates local Hispanic figures with a Hispanic Heritage Month. Still, Nayda Benitez, whose mother is undocumented and who is protected by an Obama-era rule that shields immigrants who were brought to the United States as children, said her family sometimes felt uncomfortable speaking Spanish in the city. She worried that the raid would drive even more immigrants into the shadows.\n\n\"They don't want to be targeted,\" said Ms. Benitez, the organizing director of the Colorado Immigrant Rights Coalition.\n\nOutside the nightclub site, which has been boarded up, a food truck that sells barbecued chicken has lost much of its Spanish-speaking clientele since the raid. As he dished out thighs and drumsticks from the truck this week, Luis Perez, 21, said his Mexican American family had little sympathy for anyone who was arrested that night, regardless of their immigration status.\n\nHe said he and his family had no plans to leave.\n\n\"We feel that Colorado is the safest state,\" he said.",
