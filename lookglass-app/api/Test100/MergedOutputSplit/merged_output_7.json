I'm Martin Farrer with some of the best overnight stories before Krishani Dhanji will take you through the last full day of campaigning.\n\nIt seems like political tensions have boiled over in some areas with New South Wales police launching multiple investigations in the last week into alleged violence, intimidation, harassment and antisocial behaviour related to the election. This has included the smearing of poo across a truck carrying an ad for the Liberal party. More coming up.\n\nA Liberal-aligned thinktank running last-minute anti-Greens advertisements targeting young voters received more than $600,000 from the coal industry during last year's Queensland election, disclosures show. At the same time, Labor and the Coalition have been accused of going to the election on a \"unity ticket\" to protect fossil fuels.\n\nIn what might well be the last poll before the one that really counts, Labor has a two-point lead over the Coalition on a two-party preferred basis. The Fin Review/Freshwater Strategy poll shows that Labor is on 51.5% to the Coalition's 48.5%. If replicated tomorrow that puts Labor on track for a minority government. More campaign reaction coming up.",

            "body": "Martin Scorsese will produce a new documentary featuring an on-camera interview with Pope Francis that was recorded at Vatican City in December, a few months before the pope died at the age of 88.\n\nThe film, \"Aldeas -- A New Story,\" is about the worldwide cultural project developed by Scholas Occurrentes, a global educational movement founded by Francis in 2013, the same year he was elected pope. Communities around the world will create scripts for short films that highlight their identities, histories and values.\n\nSnippets of the conversation between the pope and Scorsese will be interwoven into the film, which does not have a release date.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Scorsese said it was important to Francis for \"people across the globe to exchange ideas with respect while also preserving their cultural identity, and cinema is the best medium to do that.\" Before the pope's death, Francis called \"Aldeas\" a poetic project because it \"goes to the roots of what human life is.\"\n\nThe project punctuates a long relationship between the pope and Scorsese, whose work has sometimes been religious in nature. When \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" was released in 1988, it drew protests and outrage from religious groups.\n\nIn 2016, Scorsese met with Francis to discuss his movie \"Silence,\" a drama about a Portuguese Jesuit priest who heads to 17th-century Japan, where Christians are persecuted. They met again in 2023, when Scorsese announced he would make another film about Jesus. The director's most recent project, \"Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints,\" dramatizes the lives of eight Catholic saints.\n\nWhen Francis died, Scorsese said in a statement to Variety that he was lucky to have known him and that his loss for the world was immense.\n\n\"He had an ironclad commitment to the good,\" Scorsese said. \"He knew in his soul that ignorance was a terrible plague on humanity. So he never stopped learning. And he never stopped enlightening.\"",

            "title": "In Suits and Ties, Lawyers Protest Trump's Attacks on the Legal System",
            "body": "The National Law Day of Action, which drew roughly 1,500 people in New York City, was organized to resist the president's threats against judges and the nation's jurisprudence.\n\nThe crowd of protesters that packed Foley Square in downtown Manhattan on Thursday was as raucous as any demonstration in a politically vociferous city. It was, however, decidedly more wonky and dapper.\n\nAbout 1,500 demonstrators, many of them lawyers sporting business attire, jammed the plaza outside Manhattan's federal courthouse as part of the National Law Day of Action, chanting in favor of the rule of law and hoisting pocket Constitutions to the sky.\n\nIt was one of around 50 similar actions around the nation on Thursday, led by lawyers who say President Trump is threatening the foundation of America's legal system.\n\n\"The rule of law protects us all. Without it we will surely fall,\" the crowd chanted.\n\nIn his second term, Mr. Trump has aimed to hobble elite law firms, threatened to impeach judges and ignored their orders. For many inside the legal profession, his actions have presented an unpalatable choice between compromising their values by staying silent and facing professional risk by speaking out.\n\nNow, a growing number of lawyers see a moral imperative in choosing the latter option. They believe Mr. Trump's crusade is threatening not just their livelihoods, but a system to which they have devoted their lives. On Thursday, thousands of lawyers were expected to protest at federal courthouses in New York, Chicago and San Francisco -- roughly 50 cities in all.\n\nIn interviews, attendees of the event in New York pointed to a range of actions, including Mr. Trump's targeting of law firms he viewed as hostile, wrongful deportations and the arrest of a Wisconsin judge on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement.\n\n\"I'm horrified by what's going on,\" said James Kainen, 71, a law professor at Fordham University and a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. \"We had ethics. We prosecuted people because they violated the law, not because they angered somebody for some ridiculous reason.\"\n\nMr. Kainen held up a sign that said \"I want Perkins Coie as my law firm,\" referring to a firm that Mr. Trump has targeted with an executive order.\n\nOrganizers of the Foley Square rally instructed attendees to dress \"as if they were appearing in court,\" and encouraged them to carry pocket Constitutions.\n\n\"We want people to see that we treat this issue with utmost respect,\" said Ron Minkoff, a criminal defense lawyer and an organizer. \"This is like the courtroom to us.\"\n\nIt was not exactly a mass street protest. The jurists voiced their disapproval by ceremonially reaffirming their oath to upholding the rule of law. But the fact that lawyers are not famous for participating in demonstrations, organizers said, underscored the seriousness of the moment.\n\n\"If lawyers are taking to the streets, it means something very serious and bad is happening,\" said Traci Feit Love, the executive director of Lawyers for Good Government, a nonprofit that helped coordinate the events.\n\nThe administration's wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Mr. Trump's threats against judges were motivations for the day of action, but the president's targeting of elite law firms was a particular focus for some. Mr. Trump has unleashed a flurry of executive orders aimed at crippling firms he says have used the justice system against him. The orders have limited the firms' access to federal buildings and canceled their government contracts.\n\nTrump Administration: Live Updates\n\nUpdated\n\nMay 1, 2025, 3:34 p.m. ET55 minutes ago\n\nHawaii announced a climate lawsuit. So the government sued Hawaii first.New videos aim to persuade Chinese nationals to spy for the C.I.A.A Texas judge strikes down Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans.\n\nIn March, some of those firms started cutting deals, pledging pro bono legal support for Mr. Trump's causes in exchange for relief from his executive actions. Angered by the capitulations, organizations such as the New York County Lawyers Association and the New York Civil Liberties Union started discussing ways to stand up for what they saw as an assault on their profession.\n\n\"We're deeply concerned about the response of some of the major law firms,\" said Dawn Cardi, a defense lawyer who also helped organize the event in New York. \"It feels a little bit like I imagine it felt in the McCarthy era.\"\n\nSince the event was first envisioned, a growing number of firms have fought back, calling Mr. Trump's actions unconstitutional. Even the firms that have capitulated have seen internal dissent.\n\nLast week, lawyers for Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, both targeted by Mr. Trump, asked the courts to permanently block the orders. Hundreds of firms have signed briefs backing Perkins Coie. Last week, a federal judge stopped Mr. Trump from targeting the firm Susman Godfrey, calling it \"a shocking abuse of power.\"\n\nJ.B. Howard, a counsel in global litigation at Cadwalader, resigned after his firm made a deal with Mr. Trump.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Howard, 61, stressed that he was not angry at his firm for its decision. But he said he feared the consequences for his profession, and worried about the example he would set for his son, a law student, if he continued to work for a firm that had capitulated to Mr. Trump.\n\n\"I just can't be a practicing lawyer feeling as though I have abandoned a sacred obligation,\" Mr. Howard said. On Thursday, he attended a Law Day event in Denver, where he, along with more than 100 lawyers, entered the federal courthouse and retook their oaths.\n\nMore junior lawyers and law students have been outspoken about their outrage, even as they acknowledge the professional risks.\n\nHope Elizabeth Guzzle, a first-year law student at Fordham who attended the rally in New York, said the Trump administration's attack on legal norms had helped convince her to pursue a career in public interest law, rather than corporate law.\n\n\"The one place where there is still concern for norms and fighting back is in the law,\" said Ms. Guzzle, 24, who wore courtroom attire and held a sign that said \"Why am I even studying for my Con Law exam?\"\n\nA group of Georgetown University law students has created a spreadsheet of firms that color-codes them by whether they've capitulated to Mr. Trump, an effort first reported by the site All Rise News. In April, three anonymous law students filed suit against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, asking a federal court to bar firms from handing over sensitive information about employees to the administration.\n\nOn Tuesday, more than 1,000 law students filed an amicus brief supporting Susman Godfrey in its fight against Mr. Trump. Sam Haddad, a second-year law student at Yale Law School who signed the brief, said the Trump administration's attack on the rule of law -- and how many big firms had cut deals -- had given him pause about his career path.\n\n\"I now understand that legal professionals can hesitate, or worse, capitulate when the crisis is clear and the need to respond is unambiguous,\" Mr. Haddad, who worked at Susman as a fellow last summer, said in an interview.\n\nMr. Howard said that the firms' decisions would cost them in the fullness of time.\n\n\"These firms that are capitulating are kind of toxic to young lawyers and the next generation of lawyers,\" he said.",

            "title": "Logging devastated Victoria's native forests - and new research shows 20% has failed to grow back",
            "body": "Following the end of native logging in Victoria on January 1 2024, the state's majestic forests might be expected to regenerate and recover naturally. But our new research shows that's not always the case.\n\nWe quantified the extent of regeneration following logging in the eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia between 1980 and 2019. This included nearly 42,000 hectares of logged mountain ash forest in Victoria's Central Highlands.\n\nWe analysed satellite data, logging records, on-ground surveys and drone photography, and discovered that nearly 20% of logged areas failed to regenerate. This represents more than 8,000 hectares of forest lost. All that remains in these areas are grassy clearings, dense shrublands or bare soils.\n\nWe also found the rate of regeneration failure has increased over the past decade. While failure was rare in the 1980s, it became much more common over time - affecting more than 80% of logged sites by 2019.\n\nThese regeneration failures weren't random. They were found mostly in close proximity to each other, on areas with steep slopes, relatively low elevation, and where the area of clear-felled forest was long and narrow.\n\nOur research shows more needs to be done to restore Victoria's forest after logging.\n\nRestoring majestic forests and their vital services\n\nVictoria is home to some of the most spectacular forests on the planet. They include extensive stands of mountain ash, the tallest flowering plant on Earth, which can grow to almost 100 metres in height. Alpine ash, another giant, can grow up to 60m tall.\n\nThese forests have great cultural significance to Indigenous people and support many recreational and tourism activities.\n\nHealthy forest ecosystems also deliver clean water and carbon storage services. In fact, mountain ash forests contain more carbon per hectare than most other forests around the world.\n\nBut Victoria's forests have long been logged for timber and pulp. The main method of logging - clearfelling - scars the landscape, leaving large areas devoid of trees if natural tree regeneration fails.\n\nMountain ash is especially vulnerable\n\nOur research revealed 19.2% of areas logged between 1980 and 2019 in our study area (8,030ha out of 41,819ha cut) failed to regenerate naturally.\n\nWe also found strong evidence of a significant increase in the extent of failed regeneration over 40 years, increasing from less than two hectares per cutblock in 1980 (about 7.5%) to more than nine hectares per cutblock in 2019 (about 85%), on average.\n\nWe found regeneration failure was more likely in mountain ash forests compared with other forest types.\n\nThis adds to the case for listing the mountain ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria as a threatened ecological community.\n\nA responsibility to restore\n\nUnder Victoria's Code of Forest Practice for Timber Production, logged native forests must be properly regenerated within two to three years of harvest.\n\nThat's because it is nearly impossible for the native forest to regenerate after three years without human intervention. The young trees face too much competition from grass and shrubs.\n\nThese degraded areas no longer hold the value they once did and they cannot provide the same level of ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water purification, or habitat for wildlife.\n\nWith no current government restoration plan, these landscapes will remain degraded indefinitely. The Victorian government retains legal responsibility to restore these degraded forests, but currently lacks any large-scale restoration strategy, making action urgently required.\n\nA way forward: using green bonds to fund regeneration\n\nOur research shows the regeneration of forests after logging is not guaranteed. Nature often needs a helping hand. But we need to find ways to fund these projects.\n\nGlobally, governments have used \"green bonds\" to lower the cost of borrowing tied explicitly to measurable environmental results.\n\nVictoria already has green bonds \"to finance new and existing projects that offer climate change and environmental benefits\". But funds are typically used to finance investments in transport, renewable energy, water and low carbon buildings.\n\nAs part of a coalition of researchers, environmental organisations, and finance sector partners we proposed a A$224 million green bond for forest regeneration. This proposal was put to the Victorian government via the Treasury Corporation of Victoria.\n\nGreen bond funding would help leverage co-investment from the Commonwealth government and philanthropic partners to improve monitoring and biodiversity outcomes in native forests.\n\nAs part of the proposed green bond, areas of logged forest where natural regeneration has failed would be restored.\n\nOther investments under the green bond could include creating tourism ventures (and associated jobs), controlling feral animals such as deer, and biodiversity recovery - creating habitat for endangered species such as the southern greater glider and Leadbeater's possum, for example.\n\nThe $224 million required for the ten years of the green bond -- or around $22.4 million per year -- is less than the substantial losses Victoria incurred on its investment in VicForests over the past decade.\n\nOur research suggests leaving nature to its own devices would mean losing a fifth of the forests logged over the past 40 years. Bringing the trees back has multiple benefits and would be well worth the investment.",

            "body": "Want to stay updated on what's happening in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip? Sign up for Your Places: Global Update, and we'll send our latest coverage to your inbox.\n\nA top Trump appointee in the Justice Department ordered an aggressive investigation in the last several months of student protesters at Columbia University, raising anger and alarm among career prosecutors and investigators who saw the demand as politically motivated and lacking legal merit, people familiar with the episode said.\n\nThe demand for the inquiry into students who protested Israel's conduct of the conflict in Gaza also prompted pushback from a federal magistrate judge, who believed some of the steps being sought by the official were unjustified and might violate the First Amendment, the people said.\n\nThe breadth of the investigation, conducted by the Justice Department's civil rights division, has not been previously reported. The ensuing clash highlights the tensions roiling the department as administration officials seek to enact President Trump's agenda, including redirecting the civil rights division away from its traditional approach of protecting the rights of minority groups with a new mission to fulfill a campaign promise by cracking down on student protesters amid accusations of rampant antisemitism on college campuses.\n\nThose types of demands from political appointees at the Justice Department are part of the reason there has been an exodus of lawyers from the division in recent weeks, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe federal investigation into student protesters at Columbia appears to have stalled for now, but it represents one of the most contentious episodes yet inside the Justice Department during Mr. Trump's second term. The dispute has left lingering ill will within the department, as well as the courts and the F.B.I., the people said.\n\nAsked for comment, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said, \"This is a false story fabricated by a group of people who allowed antisemitism and support of Hamas terrorists to fester for several years, standing by but doing nothing.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has vowed to take on campus protests against Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip, saying they reflect antisemitism that must be punished. Those efforts are aimed at both college administrators, who Trump officials say should have done more to rein in campus protests, and student activists themselves, some of whom immigration officials have detained. Activists, in turn, accuse the authorities of conflating criticism of Israeli and U.S. policy with antisemitism.\n\nJustice Dept.'s Criminal Inquiry of Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms Internally - The New York Times\n\nThe investigation began shortly after masked protesters barged into Milbank Hall, a building at Barnard College, on Feb. 26 to demonstrate against the expulsion of students who had been accused of disrupting a \"History of Modern Israel\" class. Video shows students pushing past a security guard and occupying a hallway. School officials said at the time that the guard was assaulted and taken to the hospital for minor injuries.\n\nEmil Bove III, a senior Justice Department official, ordered an immediate investigation, primarily of one particular student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details intended to remain private.\n\nProdded by Mr. Bove, prosecutors in the civil rights division were told to obtain a membership list of the group. Investigators, however, pushed back on those instructions because they were skeptical such a list even existed, given the amorphous nature of online forums, and even if it did, scrutinizing people for their membership seemed like a possible violation of their First Amendment rights, these people said.\n\nOne of the Justice Department lawyers assigned to the case was Samantha Trepel, an experienced civil rights prosecutor who secured a federal conviction against Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd in 2020, these people said.\n\nThe prosecutors were told by superiors that Mr. Bove was seeking a list so the information could be shared with immigration agents, these people said. Inside the civil rights division, prosecutors came to fear that their criminal investigation was a pretext to facilitate an intimidation and deportation campaign by the Trump administration against student protesters, these people said. Prosecutors refused to compile such a list that could be given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, these people said.\n\nMr. Bove then shifted his focus to obtaining a search warrant for the group's Instagram account, these people said. He ordered prosecutors to apply for a search warrant for the nonpublic data associated with the account, these people said.\n\nThe premise of the application was also contentious within the department. Mr. Bove insisted that the Instagram account in question had been used to make a threat, while line prosecutors said the statement at issue did not meet the legal definition of a threat, these people said. In late March, the social media company suspended the group's account for failing to meet its \"community standards.\"\n\nMr. Blanche, in his statement, added that the warrant application focused on Columbia University Apartheid Divest \"included a photograph from C.U.A.D.'s social media of an inverted triangle symbol used by Hamas to designate targets for violence, which was spray-painted on Columbia property along with red paint designed to look like blood.\"\n\nHe said the investigation was \"ongoing,\" appearing to point to a related criminal investigation that the federal authorities have pursued, one that \"included an independent magistrate judge finding probable cause to believe that there was evidence on Columbia property of harboring and concealing illegal aliens.\"\n\nBefore Mr. Trump delivered a speech to the Justice Department on March 14, Mr. Blanche told the audience that the department was investigating whether anyone involved in the campus protests at Columbia violated civil rights laws and antiterrorism laws.\n\nMr. Blanche projected unwavering certainty about the wisdom of such an investigation. But behind the scenes, career lawyers had profound doubts about the merits of the case they were assigned, and deep concerns about the potential consequences if they refused.\n\nMr. Bove's demands frustrated people in the civil rights division, but many of the managers were afraid to push back, having watched a month earlier as Mr. Bove pressed prosecutors in a different division, the public integrity section, to drop criminal charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York, the three people said. That section, which once had about 30 lawyers, now has only a handful.\n\nBennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor who specializes in prosecutorial ethics, said the described conduct of Mr. Bove was \"staggering.\"\n\n\"He did something that prosecutors are absolutely forbidden to do -- use the law enforcement powers of the government to try to intimidate these individuals or destroy their rights,\" Mr. Gershman said. \"This is so far past the line of prosecutorial professionalism and the commitment to principles of justice.\"\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Blanche said that \"unethical and inaccurate claims from deep state terrorist sympathizers who stood by as members of the Jewish faith were targeted across the country\" would not deter Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and the Justice Department from \"aggressively investigating criminal conduct and rooting out antisemitism.\"\n\nWhen the federal prosecutors involved in the investigation of student protesters applied for a search warrant, a magistrate judge in New York rejected the request, finding that the government did not have sufficient probable cause, these people said.\n\nIn an unusual move, Mr. Bove insisted that the prosecutors appeal the ruling to a district court judge, these people said. After weighing the request, Judge John G. Koeltl of Federal District Court of the Southern District of New York instructed the chief magistrate judge, Sarah Netburn, to reconsider the application, the people said.\n\nBut the second time, the government lawyers fared even worse. Judge Netburn not only rejected the request for a search warrant, but she also ordered the government to abide by a special condition: Should prosecutors ever try to refile such an application before another federal judge, they had to include a transcript of the sealed discussions in her court, these people said.\n\nPart of the judge's skepticism, these people said, stemmed from the absence from the case of lawyers with the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office. But prosecutors in the Southern District of New York were wary of signing onto the effort and had minimal involvement with it, these people said. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.\n\nWhile civil rights prosecutors conducted the investigation that Mr. Bove had demanded, they often pushed back against specific steps that he wanted taken, these people said, arguing that they were either not justified by the available facts or contrary to law and past practice, or both.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Bove instructed F.B.I. agents on the joint terrorism task force in New York to put on their raid jackets, go to Columbia's campus and stand in a phalanx near any protesters. Within the civil rights division, the instruction was viewed as deeply improper and a blatant attempt to intimidate students, these people said. The F.B.I. agents did not make any such show of force.\n\nBy early April, the investigation seemed to have largely died, but nothing prevents Mr. Bove or others from reviving it. In its wake, however, people familiar with the case said it had only exacerbated the ill will and distrust between political appointees at the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington and the prosecutor's office in New York, as well as between those political appointees and veterans of the civil rights division.",
