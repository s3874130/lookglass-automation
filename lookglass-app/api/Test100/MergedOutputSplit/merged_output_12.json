What foods are healthy to eat?\n\nThe graph displays the 52 foods that The New York Times asked nutritionists and the public to rate. The Times developed this list of foods in consultation with nutrition experts and with Google Search. For the Google input, The New York Times asked Google Search which foods were most commonly part of a simple search: \"Is [blank] healthy?\"\n\nThe survey of Americans was conducted online by the Morning Consult, a media and polling firm, and included 2,000 registered voters. The survey of nutritionists was sent to the membership of the American Society of Nutrition, a professional group for nutritionists, with 672 nutritionists responding.\n\nThis graph originally appeared in The New York Times in 2016.

            "body": "\"Fabric is not made on demand. There are minimum order quantities, and there are typically huge amounts of excess fabrics left over from production because of this, and this is pervasive across the industry,\" said Holm.\n\nSince its inception in 2008, the Chinese-founded company has faced allegations regarding its ethical and environmental practices, such as greenwashing, overproduction, poor work conditions, and the use of slave and child labour.\n\nShein's own sustainability report revealed the company's carbon emissions had almost tripled in three years, making it the biggest polluter in the fashion industry.\n\nIt has sought to shake off criticisms by billing itself as environmentally minded and has outlined efforts to implement sustainable practices in its business model, primarily through an initiative called EvoluShein by Design. Shein has committed millions to initiatives tackling environmental waste, has pledged to use 31 per cent recycled polyester by 2030, and uses deadstock fabric in a small percentage of its clothing.\n\n\"Sustainability is a journey, it's not a destination,\" says Skene-Haygarth. \"I feel we're doing our part to make a real difference.\"\n\nShein confirmed only 8 per cent of the current Aralina collection is made from \"responsibly sourced\" fibres, primarily relating to viscose, which comes from \"verified responsible sourcing practices that minimise risk to ancient and endangered forests\". Shein aims to bring this to 20 per cent by the end of the year.\n\nThe rest of the collection is made from fibres such as polyester, with a few cotton and linen pieces. While viscose, or rayon, is derived from plant fibres, it is not inherently sustainable due to the significant consumption of water, energy and chemicals involved in its production, posing risks to workers and the environment.\n\nShein says while some viscose may be made in closed-loop systems (which minimise its environmental impact), it cannot provide details on what percentage of its viscose is produced this way - or provide total traceability for all of its fabrics.\n\nHolm is wary of \"conscious collections\" or phrases like \"responsible fibres\", which she says can be examples of greenwashing. \"These phrases are kind of thrown around, but what do they actually mean?\"\n\nQuaintance-James doesn't believe responsibly sourced materials or on-demand production can address the broader issue of hyper-consumption.\n\n\"Sustainability and ethics are inherently at odds with the ultra-fast fashion model, which prioritises speed, mass production and low costs over long-term environmental and social impacts,\" she says.\n\nIndeed, Holme says sustainability should be about fashion's entire life cycle. Last year, a report from The Australia Institute revealed Australia to be the world's biggest fashion consumers, with over 200,000 tonnes of clothing ending up in landfill each year. The Institute called for a change to our shopping habits, and the cheap, mass-produced clothing it said contributed to textile waste.\n\nSkene-Haygarth believes Aralina's pieces will stand the test of time.\n\n\"We have really focused on quality and not just disposable fashion,\" she says.\n\n\"We love detail and great workmanship ... I've got some [pieces] as well. I wear them. I love them, and it's not just single-use, it's something that I know I'll have in my wardrobe for a couple of years. So I don't feel like it's any different to purchasing anywhere else.\"",

            "body": "MSNBC host Jen Psaki called out Democrats for relying on \"old tactics\" on Wednesday as late-night host Stephen Colbert and the MSNBC host took aim at Sen. Chuck Schumer for the \"strong letter\" he sent to President Donald Trump.\n\nMSNBC host Jen Psaki told CBS \"Late Show\" host Stephen Colbert on Wednesday that not enough Democrats were fighting back against President Donald Trump, as the two liberals mocked Sen. Chuck Schumer's efforts.\n\n\"I think what's pretty clear is not enough of them are fighting, far too many are still relying on the old tactics of ever lore,\" Psaki told Colbert before the late-night host quickly brought up Schumer.\n\n\"But Chuck Schumer, he wrote a very strong letter,\" he said. Psaki piled on and noted that it included, \"eight strongly worded questions.\"\n\nShe quipped, \"If that's not going to make you shake in your boots, I don't know what is.\"\n\nJEN PSAKI ADMITS MSNBC'S LIBERAL VIEWERS EXPECT NEGATIVE COVERAGE OF TRUMP\n\nSchumer touted sending the president a \"strong letter\" about Trump's government funding freeze at Harvard University, during a CNN interview on Sunday.\n\nPsaki praised Illinois Gov. JB Pritzker's speech in New Hampshire on Sunday, calling it \"incredibly powerful and strong.\" In the speech, Pritzker called for mass protests against Trump.\n\nShe added that \"the message he was sending was, 'I'm a fighter, I'm going to say the things, I'm going to call out the do-nothing Democrats' - his word, not my words. He's going to call out what he's seeing in the Trump administration.\"\n\nPsaki continued, saying, \"I think what we are seeing right now is there is a divide, basically. There are people who are out there doing stuff, and by doing stuff I mean, it can be anything: go lead a protest, go to a red state, go hold a town hall, go to El Salvador. Whatever it may be, do stuff, people want to know you're fighting and doing things. If Democrats are going to rely on the tactics of old, they will lose.\"\n\n\"And so, hopefully more people come on to the fighting side,\" she added.\n\n'60 MINUTES' CALLS OUT CORPORATE OWNER PARAMOUNT ON THE AIR, SAYS PRODUCER WHO QUIT FELT INTERFERED WITH\n\nThe MSNBC host was also asked if journalists were \"caving to the pressure of the Trump administration,\" and denying the public truth.\n\n\"Yes, I mean, first of all, when you are picking out the AP and Bloomberg, I mean these are reporters who are asking things like 'what do you say about the bond market? What about these ceasefire negotiations?' They are not gotcha questions, they are there to cover the actual news, policymaking that is happening in the administration,\" she said, outlining her concerns.\n\n\"I've worked with media for more than two decades. Where the decisions are made are often behind the scenes, so there is no media organization or media outlet or reporter who is going to say, 'We are going to obey and advance now.' That's not how it's going to work.\"\n\nShe added, \"What happens is stories are killed, voices aren't invited on, stories are muted, they're watered down. We've obviously seen this happen recently, we don't know all the details behind the scenes with '60 Minutes,' but Bill Owens resigning is a significant statement of what they felt they were experiencing.\"\n\nCLICK HERE FOR MORE COVERAGE OF MEDIA AND CULTURE\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"I think most journalists are there to hold truth to power, to hold people to account, to follow the story, but where does the pressure come from at the top? And how do people respond to that? And how does that manifest itself in what news ends up on the front pages and on television? And those are pieces you will not see all of the behind-the-scenes conversations on,\" Psaki said.",

            "title": "Independents would push to end 'taboo' on tax reform in hung parliament",
            "body": "Several key independent MPs say if they are returned to parliament at May 3 and neither Labor nor the Coalition win an outright majority, they will seek a review of Australia's tax base through a \"broad-ranging\" process, saying the \"taboo\" on tax must end.\n\nIndependent MPs Allegra Spender, Kate Chaney, Zoe Daniel, Zali Steggall and Sophie Scamps have all named tax reform as an issue at the front of their priority list, with Australia's ageing working population posing a threat to future federal budgets.\n\nThat would include an honest review of current property investor subsidies of negative gearing and capital gains tax discounts.\n\nHowever, it may not necessarily be a bargaining chip in hung parliament negotiations, but rather an issue approached over the term.\n\nThe federal budget is expected to be in deficit for the next decade, which will require Australia to borrow more to fund the nation's services.\n\nBut credit rating agency Standard & Poor's is now warning that those deficit levels are putting Australia's gold standard AAA credit rating at risk -- and if deficits worsen due to election spending promises, it could force a downgrade in Australia's rating that would make paying down the nation's debt more expensive.\n\nIndependent MP Allegra Spender says she believes she has helped to create the space for MPs to discuss reform, but in the next term she will be \"expecting action as well as talk\".\n\n\"I want a broad ranging process to reform our tax system,\" Ms Spender said.\n\nThe Wentworth MP says momentum has built for reform since she entered parliament, and it has become a key issue in the dying days of the federal election campaign after S&P's warning.\n\nSeveral of the crossbenchers said the conversation must mature beyond kneejerk political reactions of talking about tax reform.\n\nCurtin independent MP Kate Chaney said that Australia's budgets were too dependent on income tax, and that would worsen as the working population ages.\n\n\"I've consistently said that tax reform shouldn't be taboo. We need to put everything on the table because right now Australia relies too heavily on personal income tax,\" Ms Chaney said.\n\n\"That's just not sustainable as our population ages. It's time to move beyond short-term fixes and start having honest conversations about long-term reforms that will set Australia up for the future.\"\n\nNegative gearing and CGT 'absolutely' part of good-faith review\n\nHowever, on one of the most contentious tax issues -- tax breaks for property investors -- both Prime Minister Anthony Albanese and Opposition Leader Peter Dutton have already ruled out touching the settings of negative gearing or capital gains tax discounts.\n\nGoldstein MP Zoe Daniel says those property investor discounts would have to form part of any honest conversation.\n\n\"I think the first step is getting the review without any pre-conceived assumptions about what the review might yield,\" Ms Daniel said.\n\n\"But I also think any unintended consequences, or the full consequences of changing the system would have to be considered.\"\n\nMs Daniel noted that consequences for housing supply or self-funded retirees who have used investment properties as a form of superannuation would be among the concerns that would need to be investigated.\n\nWarringah MP Zali Steggall agreed that the budget burden of negative gearing and CGT merited review, but said the ultimate goal was to repair the budget's structural issues.\n\n\"The bigger question is reform around where the revenue base comes from, because at the moment we overwhelmingly rely on taxing individuals,\" Ms Steggall said.\n\nThe Warringah MP named subsidies offered to the \"fossil fuel\" resources sector as one area for attention, something also raised by Mackellar MP Sophie Scamps.\n\nMs Scamps said there was wide acceptance that parliament was \"well overdue for reform of our tax system as a whole\".\n\n\"We are too heavily reliant on personal income tax, yet derive very little tax revenue from the export of our resources. Productivity has stagnated for decades, small businesses are closing all across the country including in Mackellar, and young people are being left behind,\" Ms Scamps said.\n\n'Some level of acceptance on both sides'\n\nMs Steggall said she was open-minded about how reform could be approached, including whether it would be part of hung parliament discussions or something raised over the course of the next parliament -- saying that would have to depend on Saturday's result.\n\nThe independent added that depending on the size of the crossbench she expected a first priority for crossbenchers would be to come together collectively to assess priorities, and avoid being \"picked off\" individually by either of the major parties.\n\nMs Daniel agreed that the approach would depend on the makeup of the next parliament.\n\n\"It does depend to some degree on what the level of willingness or inclination within those initial conversations with both sides,\" she said.\n\n\"I sense some level of acceptance on both sides it might be good to do, much as the political risk for them is high, which is why it has been left to the crossbench to prosecute the reasons for an 'everything on the table' tax review.\"\n\nThe independents elected to parliament in the 2022 teal wave have reaffirmed they would be willing to support either Anthony Albanese or Peter Dutton to form government if a hung parliament is returned -- though the final seat result and therefore the ability of either Labor or the Coalition to run a \"stable government\" would influence who they would support.\n\nLack of nuclear detail a hurdle for several independents\n\nSeveral of the crossbenchers have also singled out the Coalition's nuclear policy as a hurdle to any offer of confidence and supply, questioning the party's commitment to a supposed signature policy.\n\nMs Daniel said there were still a number of holes in the detail.\n\n\"The thing with the nuclear plan is that it still feels sort of like a bit of a figment of the Coalition's imagination,\" Ms Daniel said.\n\nMs Scamps said in order to make any decisions in a minority government negotiation, she would want to see policies underpinned by evidence that parties had done \"the hard work\" in terms of modelling long-term impacts.\n\n\"Nuclear is a good example -- is that still Coalition policy, or not? Mr Dutton seems to have stopped talking about it,\" Ms Scamps said.\n\nMs Steggall said her questions came from a committee she sat on with now-Shadow Energy Minister Ted O'Brien.\n\n\"Ironically at the time, the Coalition acknowledged large-scale nuclear was not feasible and should be ruled out, but left open the question of small modular reactors,\" Ms Steggall said.\n\nThe Warringah MP said nuclear could play a role for shifting the final 10 per cent of the electricity grid to renewables, but found it \"hard to fathom\" why the Coalition was ignoring its own findings from that nuclear inquiry.\n\nHung result unlikely to be repeat of 2010\n\nCrossbenchers previously told the ABC that if neither major party could win an outright majority in the lower house the minority government result would still look different to former prime minister Julia Gillard's 2010 minority government.\n\nVeteran independent MPs of that era, Andrew Wilkie and Bob Katter, both said a hung parliament result this time would not be a repeat of 2010 -- with both saying this time they would not be willing to sign formal governing agreements.\n\nMost of the crossbench has agreed they would not seek formal agreements and instead retain the ability to negotiate with the government bill by bill, supporting or opposing each on its merits.\n\nThe options for forming government could also be far simpler, depending on how many seats short of a majority either of the major parties fell.\n\nThe current crossbench is far larger than at any other point in parliament's modern history, and while not all of them may be returned, a prospective minority government could have many more options when negotiating with the crossbench than Ms Gillard and then-opposition leader Tony Abbott had in 2010.\n\nOnly former Liberal Ian Goodenough and independent Dai Le previously indicated to the ABC they would be open to striking formal agreements, though ex-Nationals MP Andrew Gee did not rule in or out whether he would be prepared to sign a binding agreement.\n\nThe Greens, who had four lower house MPs in the most recent parliament, have declared their desire to strike a formal agreement with Labor if it fell into minority -- though Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has ruled out the prospect of a formal deal with the minor party.",

Cut it out!\n\nThere is no bad blood between the \"Full House\" stars, who played sisters DJ and Stephanie Tanner, respectively, on the ABC sitcom that ran for eight seasons from 1987 to 1995.\n\nLast summer, Sweetin, 43, and Bure, 49, had different opinions over the Paris Olympics -- with \"The Jane Mysteries\" star calling out conservatives for their harsh opinions on the opening ceremony, which featured drag queens.\n\nBure dubbed the number, which referenced Leonardo Da Vinci's \"The Last Supper,\" \"disgusting\" and said it was mocking \"the Christian faith.\"\n\nDespite their dueling feelings, Sweetin set the record straight on where she stands with her on-screen sibling.\n\n\"Tell us you don't know about art,'\" host Amir Yass said on the latest episode of his \"The Vault\" podcast, quoting Sweetin. \"You were speaking about her...\"\n\nThe \"How Rude, Tanneritos!\" podcast host quickly clarified: \"To be honest, I wasn't speaking about her.\"\n\n\"There was already something that had happened where we went on a divergent path,\" explained Sweetin. \"And then I saw the Olympics thing and how people were freaking out about it, so I said, 'Oh my God, tell me you don't know anything about art history without telling me you know nothing,' and everyone was like, 'She came for Candace!'\"\n\nThe \"Fuller House\" star admitted she was shocked by that rumor.\n\nSweetin recalled, \"And I was like, 'What the...?' I was, like, getting a massage or something, and I came out to all of this, and I was like, 'What did I...? Oh, she said....ohhhhhh. Well, I guess that's it!'\"\n\n\"I'm not changing anything I said,\" she insisted. \"But it was not an intentional dig. But it was still what I wanted to say.\"\n\n\"It's funny, we've never actually 'gotten into it',\" she said. \"She posted her viewpoint and I posted mine, and we've always been very different on those things. I think it was just... now all of that comes to the surface more.\"\n\nThe \"Full House\" cast -- which also included the late Bob Saget, Lori Loughlin, John Stamos, Dave Coulier, Andrea Barber and Mary-Kate and Ashley Olsen -- have always been close.\n\nMost of the main cast, minus the Olsen twins, reunited for five seasons of Netflix's \"Fuller House\" from 2016-2020.\n\n\"Candace and I have just lived very different...lifestyles,\" Sweetin expressed. \"We just exist in different worlds, but she is still someone I have known since I was 5 years old.\"\n\n\"It's like family members,\" she added. \"Maybe we don't talk all the time, and I know if politics comes up it is not going to go well, but I don't hate you. I am not going to not hug you, but I'm also not going to not keep my mouth shut. So that's what I did. That's how I look at it. You don't want to follow or whatever, that's cool.\"\n\nAs Sweetin put it, \"I'll be nice, but I will not be quiet.\"\n\nIn 2022, however, Bure unfollowed Sweetin on Instagram after the Hallmark star supported JoJo Siwa who criticized Bure's comments about Great American Family's programming showing traditional families.\n\nSweetin noted, \"I'm not gonna unfollow anybody!\"\n\n\"I don't live my life based on social media,\" she shared. \"I think it can be used for some great things, and I also think it can be really negative and full of a lot of shit, particularly these days.\"\n\n\"Unfollow me, don't follow, whatevs,\" Sweetin stated. \"People announce their departure. It's like, 'Cool, yeah, goodbye! You live in fucking Wyoming. I don't know you!' And if people I do know unfollow me because of what I passionately believe in, then we are just very different people.\"\n\nIn 2022, Bure defended herself and her network, which she is the CCO at, from the backlash about showing traditional marriage in her programming.\n\n\"All of you who know me, know beyond question that I have great love and affection for all people. It absolutely breaks my heart that anyone would ever think I intentionally would want to offend and hurt anyone,\" she told People. \"It saddens me that the media is often seeking to divide us, even around a subject as comforting and merry as Christmas movies. But, given the toxic climate in our culture right now, I shouldn't be surprised. We need Christmas more than ever.\"\n\nThe \"Ainsley McGregor Mysteries\" star also spoke about her faith, adding, \"I am a devoted Christian. Which means that I believe that every human being bears the image of God. Because of that, I am called to love all people, and I do. If you know me, you know that I am a person who loves fiercely and indiscriminately.\"",
