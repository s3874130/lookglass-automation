            "body": "Miserly Australia tumbles down global generosity tableBen McKayAAPFri, 2 May 2025 1:36AM\n\nThe development sector has been dismayed by the coalition's pledge to cut foreign aid, which would see Australia tumble further down the ranks of global generosity.\n\nOn Thursday, the coalition announced it would axe $813 million in planned development assistance over the next four years.\n\nThe Pacific will be ring-fenced from any cuts.\n\nThe aid downgrade was widely expected in the sector, given Peter Dutton had been non-committal on questions about possible savings during the election campaign.\n\nAt a time of geopolitical tumult, Australian Council for International Development chief executive Matthew Maury said any cuts to aid would make Australia \"a less reliable global partner\".\n\n\"At a time when the world is facing huge global challenges, we urge the coalition to consider the bipartisan commitment to aid that has cemented Australia's standing in our region over decades,\" he said.\n\nEarlier this week, the coalition offered increased spending to the Pacific in one key area: infrastructure.\n\nShould Mr Dutton's party form government after Saturday's election, the coalition would lift infrastructure funding - through grants and loans - by $2 billion.\n\nACFID questioned the priority on infrastructure, saying \"most Pacific states cannot afford expensive loans\".\n\n\"The net result of the coalition's election announcements will impact millions of the world's most vulnerable facing rising hunger, conflict, disease and climate disasters,\" Mr Maury said.\n\nThe coalition made savage cuts to foreign aid the last time it won government from Labor, under Tony Abbott.\n\nSince taking office in 2022, Anthony Albanese's Labor government has increased foreign aid each year, but at a slower rate than Australian prosperity has grown.\n\nAs a share of gross national income (GNI), Australia spends 0.19 per cent on aid - ranking it 28th of 32 developed nations. On that measure, just four nations spend less: Czech Republic, Greece, Slovakia and Hungary.\n\nA decade earlier, Australia spent 0.31 per cent of GNI, and was ranked 13th.\n\nMr Maury said both major parties had an obligation to lift spending to support some of the world's poorest nations, calling on aid to all candidates to make aid at least one per cent of the budget, up from 0.68 per cent.\n\n\"The aid budget is already at a historic low,\" he said.\n\n\"With the challenges facing Australia and the whole world now is the worst time to be pulling back and making further cuts.\"\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

            "title": "The 141 executive orders Trump signed in his first 100 days",
            "body": "Trump 100 days: inside Trump's whirlwind start to his second presidency\n\nDonald Trump signed 141 executive orders since returning to the presidency in January, including enacting steep tariffs, ending birthright citizenship, curbing DEI and \"gender radicalism\" in the military, and pardoning January 6 rioters.\n\nThe US president promised in his inaugural speech that these orders would amount to a \"complete restoration of America\".\n\nHere's what to know about the major executive orders Trump signed in his first 100 days in office.\n\nThe orders: Trump signed three executive orders on 1 February placing tariffs on Mexico, China and Canada, to begin on 4 February.\n\nWhat the orders say: The Mexico order says that drug traffickers and the country's government \"have an intolerable alliance\" that endangers US security. The China order says the country's government allows criminal organizations to \"launder the revenues from the production, shipment, and sale of illicit synthetic opioids\". The Canada order says that Mexican cartels are operating in that country, claiming the amount of fentanyl imported could kill \"9.5 million Americans\".\n\nWhat it means: All three countries announced retaliatory actions. On 3 February, Trump agreed to postpone tariffs against Mexico and Canada for one month after they committed to increasing border enforcement. China has announced retaliatory tariffs on some American imports and an antitrust investigation into Google on 4 February after Trump's tariffs took effect.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 2 April implementing what he called \"reciprocal tariffs\".\n\nWhat Trump said: \"April 2, 2025, will forever be remembered as the day American industry was reborn. For decades our country has been looted, pillaged, raped and plundered by nations near and far,\" Trump said at a \"liberation day\" event in the White House Rose Garden.\n\nWhat it means: The tariffs range from 10% to 49% on all goods imported from abroad, and include a 25% tariff on all foreign automakers. World leaders responded to the news with a mix of confusion and concern.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 29 April on auto tariffs, watering down his sweeping plan. Trump curbed some duties on foreign cars and parts, granting a reprieve to the industry.\n\nWhat it means: Carmakers subject to a 25% tariff on imports will not be subject to other levies Trump has imposed, for example, on steel and aluminum. US automakers will also be allowed to apply for tariff relief on a proportion of the costs imposed for imported parts, although that relief will be phased out over the next two years.\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump told reporters he wanted US automakers to \"enjoy this little transition short-term\".\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 2 April closing \"the de minimus loophole\" on China.\n\nWhat it means: The loophole allowed the China to export cheap goods to the US without paying taxes and import duties.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 6 March that will delay tariffs on goods from Mexico and Canada covered by a free trade agreement between the three countries.\n\nWhat it means: Goods imported to the United States under the United States-Mexico-Canada Agreement will be exempted from Trump's 25% tariffs for one month until 2 April.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"During this interim period between now and April 2, this makes it much more favorable for our American car manufacturers,\" Trump said.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 6 March to establish a strategic bitcoin reserve.\n\nWhat it means: The reserve \"will be capitalized with bitcoin owned by the federal government that was forfeited as part of criminal or civil asset forfeiture proceedings\", according to Trump's crypto czar, David Sacks. Creating the reserve was one of several crypto-related promises Trump made during last year's election campaign.\n\nThe order: Trump announced 25% tariffs on foreign steel and aluminum on 11 February, which will be enforced \"without exceptions or exemptions\". The action ends exemptions granted to certain countries and increases the duty rate on both metals to 25% (the duty on aluminum was previously 10%).\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump's top trade adviser, Peter Navarro, said the tariffs were not just about trade. \"It's about ensuring that America never has to rely on foreign nations for critical industries like steel and aluminum,\" he said.\n\nWhat to know: The changes are not due to come into effect until 12 March, raising the prospect the administration will broker deals with governments seeking reprieve.\n\nThe order: Trump ordered the US treasury and commerce department to create a sovereign wealth fund on 3 February. Such a fund, which requires congressional approval, would act as an investment fund for the country, operating outside the Federal Reserve and the treasury department.\n\nTrump offered few details about the fund, including where the cash would come from. His treasury secretary and the nominee for commerce secretary would spearhead efforts to create the fund. Treasury secretary Scott Bessent told reporters the government would \"stand this thing up within the next 12 months\".\n\nWhat Trump said: \"We have tremendous potential,\" Trump said. \"I think in a short period of time, we'd have one of the biggest funds.\"\n\nTrump also said that the fund could be used to facilitate the purchase of TikTok.\n\nWhat to know: More than 100 countries and 20 US states have sovereign wealth funds. Senior officials in the Biden administration had been quietly working on a sovereign wealth fund before the US election in November, according to multiple reports.\n\nThe order: On 23 January, Trump signed an executive order calling for a review of all Biden policies on AI, to remove policies that \"act as barriers to American AI innovation\". A second order called for a working group to start work on crypto regulations.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"We must develop AI systems that are free from ideological bias or engineered social agendas\" to maintain the US's dominant position in AI technology, the order states.\n\nWhat it means: Former PayPal executive David Sacks has been tasked with leading a group to develop an AI action plan. Meanwhile another working group will start work on crypto regulations.\n\nThe order: Trump signed executive orders on 23 April targeting universities, with actions addressing foreign gifts, and directing the federal government to \"enforce laws on the books\" related to the disclosure of large donations, and college accreditation.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"We should be looking at those who have real merit to get in, and we have to look harder at those universities that aren't enforcing that,\" Trump's education secretary, Linda McMahon, said during the signing.\n\nWhat it means: The order comes as Trump's administration seeks to reshape higher-education institutions and continues to crack down on diversity and inclusion efforts.\n\nThe order: Trump signed two new executive orders on 28 April related to immigration: one targeting so-called \"sanctuary cities\", and another the administration says will \"strengthen and unleash\" law enforcement to pursue \"criminals\".\n\nWhat Trump said: The order targeting \"sanctuary cities\" calls for a list of state and local jurisdictions that \"obstruct the enforcement of federal immigration laws\", while the other directs support for officers who \"unjustly\" face legal costs from actions taken while performing official duties.\n\nThe order: Trump signed a handful of executive orders on 9 April punishing prominent law firms and attorneys that are connected to his rivals or that have taken on causes averse to his administration.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"There were some very bad things that happened with these law firms,\" he said in the Oval Office when signing an order against Susman Godfrey, the firm that obtained a $787.5m settlement from Fox for lies about the 2020 election.\n\nWhat it means: Trump has singled out numerous law firms, and others have struck deals with the president to avoid being targeted.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 19 February making independent regulatory agencies - such as Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) and the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) - accountable to the White House. Agencies will have to report new policy priorities to the executive branch for approval, which will also have a say over their budgets.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order ensures \"all federal agencies are accountable to the American people, as required by the constitution\", a White House fact sheet reads.\n\nWhat it means: The move comes as the White House has attempted to fundamentally reshape the US government. It makes agencies established by Congress accountable to the White House, a move that some experts say clashes with mainstream interpretations of the constitution.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 10 February directing the US justice department to halt prosecuting Americans accused of bribing foreign government officials to win business. It instructs the US attorney general, Pam Bondi, to pause prosecutions under the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act of 1977 until she issues revised enforcement guidance that promotes American competitiveness.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"It's going to mean a lot more business for America,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat to know: The White House says the law puts US firms at a disadvantage to foreign competitors because they cannot engage in practices that are \"common among international competitors, creating an uneven playing field\".\n\nThe order: Trump signed three executive orders on 27 January that would reshape the military: removing diversity, equity and inclusion efforts; eliminating \"gender radicalism\" from the military; and reinstating soldiers who were expelled for refusing Covid-19 vaccines.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"To ensure we have the most lethal fighting force in the world, we will get transgender ideology the hell out of our military. It's going to be gone,\" Trump said in Florida, according to CBS.\n\nWhat to know: Trump's order does not yet ban transgender soldiers from the military, but directs the Pentagon to create a policy for trans members of the military.\n\nThe order: Trump issued pardons for offenders and commutations related to the January 6 attack on the US Capitol on 20 January. He will direct the Department of Justice to dismiss cases currently in progress.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'm going to be signing on the J6 hostages, pardons, to get them out,\" Trump said during his rally speech. \"We'll be signing pardons for a lot of people, a lot of people.\" Trump said he has pardoned about 1,500 defendants charged in the January 6 attack on the US Capitol and issued six commutations.\n\nWhat it means: Trump made his pledge to issue pardons for those with convictions related to the January 6 Capitol attack a core part of his re-election campaign. On the campaign trail, Trump often featured the national anthem sung by prisoners in a Washington DC jail. There are more than 1,500 people federally charged with associated charges.\n\nWith Trump back in the White House, justice department investigations into January 6 crimes are expected to cease.\n\nThe order: Trump has signed an executive order on 20 February aimed at ending federal benefits for people in the country illegally.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order did not make it clear which benefits will be targeted, but said it will do away with all \"all taxpayer-funded benefits for illegal aliens\".\n\nWhat it means: This is part of broader efforts on immigration to fulfill Trump's promise to remove millions of people from the country.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 29 January to prepare a huge detention facility at Guant\u00e1namo Bay that he said could be used to hold up to 30,000 immigrants deported from the US.\n\nWhat Trump said: Guant\u00e1namo could \"detain the worst criminal illegal aliens threatening the American people\", Trump said during the signing of the Laken Riley Act, another of his administration's hardline immigration policies.\n\nWhat it means: The order is part of a broader effort to fulfill Trump's promise to remove millions of people from the country.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 27 January that would begin the process of creating a \"next-generation\" missile defense shield, which the administration is referring to as the American Iron Dome.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The United States will provide for the common defense of its citizens and the Nation by deploying and maintaining a next-generation missile defense shield,\" the order said.\n\nWhat to know: Creating a short-range missile defense system akin to Israel's Iron Dome would take years to build. The order calls for a plan from the defense secretary, Pete Hegseth, within 60 days.\n\nThe order: On his first day in office on 20 January, Trump targeted automatic citizenship for US-born children of both undocumented people and some legal immigrants.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order specifies that it would limit birthright citizenship if a person's \"mother was unlawfully present in the United States and the father was not a United States citizen or lawful permanent resident at the time of said person's birth\", or \"when that person's mother's presence in the United States at the time of said person's birth was lawful but temporary\".\n\nWhat it means: Birthright citizenship, which guarantees citizenship to anyone born on US soil, is protected by the 14th amendment and any attempt to revoke it will bring immediate legal challenges. The order was temporarily blocked on 23 January, with the judge calling it \"blatantly unconstitutional\".\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 23 January suspending the country's refugee resettlement program. Refugees maybe only be admitted on a case-by-case basis so long as their entry is in the \"national interest\".\n\nWhat Trump said: The order cited \"record levels of migration\" to the US and said the country did not have the ability to \"absorb large numbers of migrants, and in particular, refugees\".\n\nWhat it means: Advocates say the move put lives in danger and has left families devastated. Thousands of refugees are now stranded around the globe.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 2o January declaring an emergency at the southern US border, along with several other immigration-related policies.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"All illegal entry will immediately be halted, and we will begin the process of returning millions and millions of criminal aliens back to the places from which they came,\" Trump said in his inauguration speech.\n\nWhat it means: The executive action paves the way to send US troops to the southern border and makes good on campaign promises to implement hardline immigration policies. There are limited details about how the administration plans to execute its sprawling set of immigration actions that were all but certain to face legal and logistical challenges.\n\nImmigrant communities across the country have been braced for Trump's promise to carry out the \"largest deportation program in American history\".\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 24 April making it easier to fire federal workers within their probationary period. These probationary employees already have fewer protections and were earlier targets of the administration.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The American people deserve a Federal workforce that is high-quality, efficient, dedicated to the public interest, and no larger than necessary,\" the order read.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 20 March that would begin the process of dismantling the Department of Education.\n\nWhat it means: The order seemingly attempts to circumvent the need to obtain congressional approval to formally close a federal department.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"My administration will take all lawful steps to shut down the department. We're going to shut it down and shut it down as quickly as possible. It's doing us no good.\"\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 26 February expanding the power of Musk's so-called \"department of government efficiency\". It calls for a \"transformation\" in federal spending on contracts, grants and loans by requiring a centralized payment system - an initiative that would be monitored by Musk's team.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"This order commences a transformation in Federal spending on contracts, grants, and loans to ensure Government spending is transparent and Government employees are accountable to the American public,\" the order states.\n\nWhat it means: The order is part of a much broader effort by the White House to dramatically reduce the size of the federal workforce.\n\nThe order: Trump instructed the heads of every agency to undertake a review of all regulations on 19 February, working with members of Elon Musk's so-called \"department of government efficiency.\" It also targets a number of advisory committees and agencies for elimination.\n\nWhat Trump said: Any regulations that are deemed inconsistent with the administration's policies will be rescinded or modified, the order said.\n\nWhat it means: The action aims to bolster Musk's sweeping government-slashing effort, which is facing numerous court challenges over its lawfulness, and Trump's broader campaign to assert control over independent executive agencies.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 7 February attempting to eliminate \"anti-Christian bias\" in the US government. The president announced the formation of a taskforce, led by Bondi, to end all forms of \"anti-Christian targeting and discrimination\" in the government.\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump said Bondi would work to \"fully prosecute anti-Christian violence and vandalism in our society and to move heaven and earth to defend the rights of Christians and religious believers nationwide\".\n\nWhat it means: The order is meant to reverse alleged targeting of \"peaceful Christians\" under Biden. Critics say it changes the traditional understanding of religious liberty, with Americans United for Separation of Church and State saying in a statement that Trump's taskforce would \"misuse religious freedom to justify bigotry, discrimination and the subversion of our civil rights laws\".\n\nThe order: Trump ordered a review of Federal Emergency Management Agency (Fema) on 27 January, the disaster response agency, and suggested there is \"political bias\" in the agency. Trump previously criticized the agency's response to Hurricane Helene.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Despite obligating nearly $30 billion in disaster aid each of the past three years, Fema has managed to leave vulnerable Americans without the resources or support they need when they need it most,\" the order stated.\n\nWhat it means: A review council - which includes the secretaries of defense and homeland security, Pete Hegseth and Kristi Noem - will report to Trump within 180 days.\n\nThe order: Trump's executive order on 20 January reclassified thousands of federal employees as political hires, making it much easier for them to be fired.\n\nWhat Trump said: Aides to the president have long heralded mass government firings as part of an attack on the so-called \"administrative\" or \"deep\" state.\n\nWhat it means: Trump in effect reinstates \"Schedule F\", an executive order he signed in the last year of his first term, seeking to reclassify tens of thousands of federal workers. (Biden rescinded the order.)\n\nKey aides to Trump have called for mass government firings. Project 2025 made attacks on the deep or administrative state a core part of Trump's second term. The rightwing playbook called for civil servants deemed politically unreliable to be fired and replaced by conservatives.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 6 February authorizing economic sanctions on the international criminal court (ICC), accusing the body of \"improperly targeting\" the United States and its allies, such as Israel.\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump has been a vocal critic of the ICC and said the court had \"abused its power\" in issuing warrants for Benjamin Netanyahu and his former defense minister Yoav Gallant for alleged war crimes. \"This malign conduct in turn threatens to infringe upon the sovereignty of the United States and undermines the critical national security and foreign policy work of the United States government and our allies, including Israel,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat it means: The order grants Trump broad powers to impose asset freezes and travel bans against ICC staff and their family members if the US determines that they are involved in efforts to investigate or prosecute citizens of the US and certain allies.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 4 February stopping funding for Unrwa, the UN agency for Palestinian refugees, and withdrawing US from the UN human rights council.\n\nWhat Trump said: The president criticized the entire United Nations as \"not being well run\" and \"not doing the job\".\n\nWhat to know: In his first term, Trump cut Unrwa funding and withdrew from the UN's human rights council. The Biden administration restored Unrwa funding and rejoined the council.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"World Health ripped us off, everybody rips off the United States. It's not going to happen any more,\" Trump said at the signing. He accused the WHO of mishandling the Covid-19 pandemic and other international health crises.\n\nWhat it means: The US will leave the WHO in 12 months' time and stop all financial contributions to its work. The US is the biggest financial backer to the United Nations health agency.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 24 April aimed at boosting the deep-sea mining industry. It's part of a push to offset China's sweeping control of the critical minerals industry.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"We want the US to get ahead of China in this resource space under the ocean, on the ocean bottom,\" a Trump official said.\n\nWhat it means: The order is Trump's latest attempt to boost US production of nickel, copper and other critical minerals used widely across the economy.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 8 April instructing the Department of Justice to \"stop the enforcement\" of state climate laws, which his administration has suggested are unconstitutional or otherwise unenforceable.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"These State laws and policies are fundamentally irreconcilable with my Administration's objective to unleash American energy,\" the executive order says. \"They should not stand.\"\n\nThe orders: Trump signed four executive orders on 8 April aimed at reviving the coal industry in the US. He used his emergency authority to allow some older coal-fired power plants scheduled for retirement to keep producing electricity, something the White House said is needed to meet increased energy demands from growth in datacenters, artificial intelligence and electric cars.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order \"slashes unnecessary regulations that targeted the beautiful, clean coal\".\n\nWhat it means: Coal is the dirtiest fossil fuel and its usage has long been in decline.\n\nThe order: Trump has ordered an expansion on 3 March in tree-cutting across 280m acres (113m hectares) of national forests and other public lands.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order calls for reversing \"heavy-handed federal policies\" and increasing \"domestic timber production to protect our national and economic security\".\n\nWhat it means: The order evades rules to protect endangered species and raises the prospect of chainsaws razing some of the most ecologically important trees in the US.\n\nThe order: Trump declared a national energy emergency on 20 January as part of a barrage of pro-fossil fuel actions and efforts to \"unleash\" already booming US energy production that included also rolling back restrictions in drilling in Alaska and undoing a pause on gas exports.\n\nWhat Trump said: The order means \"you can do whatever you have to do to get out of that problem and we do have that kind of emergency\", Trump said. The order also says it is US policy for the country to \"fully avail itself of Alaska's vast lands and resources\".\n\nWhat it means: The declaration would allow his administration to fast-track permits for new fossil fuel infrastructure. It is likely that the order, part of a broader effort to roll back climate policy, will face legal challenges.\n\nThe order: Trump revoked a non-binding executive order on 20 January signed by Joe Biden aimed at making half of all new vehicles sold in 2030 electric.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The United States will not sabotage our own industries while China pollutes with impunity,\" Trump said.\n\nWhat it means: Part of an effort to repeal Biden's environmental protections, Trump has also promised to roll back auto pollution standards finalized by Biden's administration last spring.\n\nThe order: Trump signed a wide-ranging executive action on 15 April aimed at lowering prescription drug prices.\n\nWhat it means: Trump directed his health department to work with Congress on revamping a law that allows Medicare to negotiate prescription drug prices, seeking to introduce a change the pharmaceutical industry has lobbied for.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 4 April to extend the TikTok ban deadline.\n\nWhat Trump said: The TikTok deal \"requires more work to ensure all necessary approvals are signed\", Trump said on Truth Social.\n\nWhat it means: This was the second time the president delayed the ban or sale of TikTok. The move punts the deadline to 75 days from 4 April.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 28 April requiring commercial truck drivers to read and speak English.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"They should be able to read and understand traffic signs, communicate with traffic safety, border patrol, agricultural checkpoints, and cargo weight-limit station officers,\" the order said. \"This is common sense.\"\n\nWhat it means: Trump issued an order in March making English the official language of the United States.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 25 March to modernize the payment system at the US treasury.\n\nWhat it means: The order is meant to reduce potential fraud and abuse. It calls for accepting electronic payments whenever possible instead of physical checks.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order barring government and non-profit employees from a student loan forgiveness program if they engage in \"improper activities\".\n\nWhat it means: The order would disqualify workers at non-profit groups deemed to have engaged in certain activities from accessing the Public Service Loan Forgiveness program. That includes people whose work is tied to illegal immigration, foreign terrorist groups or other illegal activity. It's likely to face legal challenges.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 1 March making English the official language of the United States.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Establishing English as the official language will not only streamline communication but also reinforce shared national values, and create a more cohesive and efficient society,\" the order said.\n\nWhat it means: The US previously did not have an official language at the federal language. Hundreds of languages of are spoken across country, with English the most common. The order allows government agencies and organizations that receive federal funding to choose whether to continue to offer documents and services in languages other than English.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 25 February attempting to impose price transparency on healthcare costs. The rule requires hospitals to publish online the prices for some of their most common services.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"You're not allowed to even talk about it when you're going to a hospital or see a doctor. And this allows you to go out and talk about it,\" Trump said while signing the order. \"It's been unpopular in some circles because people make less money, but it's great for the patient.\"\n\nWhat it means: Trump previously issued a similar order in 2019, but hospitals and insurers strongly opposed the rule, with many failing to comply.\n\nThe order: Trump has signed an executive order on 18 February to expand access to in vitro fertilization (IVF). It directs the domestic policy council to make recommendations to \"aggressively\" reduce the costs for accessing IVF, according to a White House fact sheet.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"It is the policy of my administration to ensure reliable access to IVF treatment, including by easing unnecessary statutory or regulatory burdens to make IVF treatment drastically more affordable,\" a White House fact sheet reads.\n\nWhat to know: The order does not directly change any policy and does not, on its own, fulfill Trump's campaign pledge to make the government or insurance companies cover IVF.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 10 February ending the \"procurement and forced use of paper straws\". It calls for government agencies to stop buying paper straws and to create a strategy to eliminate them across the country.\n\nWhat Trump said: Trump, who sold branded plastic straws on the campaign trail last year, said paper straws don't work. \"These things don't work,\" he said, referring to paper straws. \"I've had them many times, and on occasion, they break, they explode.\"\n\nWhat to know: In 2024, the Biden administration announced that it would gradually phase out single-use plastics from federal operations by 2035.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an executive order on 5 February banning transgender athletes from participating in women's sport. It directs federal agencies, including the Department of Justice, to interpret federal Title IX rules as the prohibition of trans girls and women from participating in any female sports categories.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"With this executive order, the war on women's sports is over.\"\n\nWhat it means: The order is the latest in a slew of Trump actions aimed at rolling back the rights of trans people. Trump also signed orders defining sex as \"only male or female\" and banning gender transitions for people under the age of 19.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 28 January that attempts to end gender transitions for people under 19.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"It is the policy of the United States that it will not fund, sponsor, promote, assist, or support the so-called 'transition' of a child from one sex to another, and it will rigorously enforce all laws that prohibit or limit these destructive and life-altering procedures,\" reads the order.\n\nWhat it means: The order directs that federally run insurance programs, including Tricare for military families and Medicaid, exclude coverage for such care. The order calls on the Department of Justice to vigorously pursue litigation and legislation to oppose the practice.\n\nThe order: On 23 January Trump ordered the release of thousands of classified documents on the assassinations of John F Kennedy, Robert F Kennedy and Martin Luther King Jr.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"The federal government has not released to the public all of its records related to those events. Their families and the American people deserve transparency and truth. It is in the national interest to finally release all records related to these assassinations without delay,\" the order said.\n\nWhat it means: Trump made this promise during the election campaign and made a similar pledge in his first term, but ultimately heeded appeals from the CIA and FBI to withhold some documents.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"President Trump is bringing common sense to government and renewing the pillars of American Civilization,\" the executive order said in part.\n\nWhat it means: Trump ordered the Gulf of Mexico to be renamed the \"Gulf of America\" and will rechristen Alaska's Mount Denali as Mount McKinley.\n\nIt will have no bearing on what names are used internationally.\n\nThe order: Trump signed an order on 20 January to remove \"gender ideology guidance\" from federal government communication, policies and forms. The order makes it official policy that there are \"only two genders, male and female\".\n\nWhat Trump said: \"Agencies will cease pretending that men can be women and women can be men when enforcing laws that protect against sex discrimination,\" the order states.\n\nWhat it means: The order reverses a Biden-era executive action on the acceptance of gender identity.\n\nThe order: Trump ordered 78 Biden-era executive actions to be rescinded on 20 January, including at least a dozen measures supporting racial equity and combating discrimination against gay and transgender people.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I'll revoke nearly 80 destructive and radical executive actions of the previous administration,\" Trump told a crowd in Washington after his inaugural speech. He also said he would end policy \"trying to socially engineer race and gender into every aspect of public and private life\" and push for a \"color blind and merit-based\" society.\n\nWhat it means: The orders signal a reversal of Biden-era policy that prioritized implementing diversity measures across the federal government. Trump repealed orders signed by Biden advancing racial equity for underserved communities and the aforementioned order combating discrimination based on gender identity or sexual orientation.\n\nThe order: Trump issued an executive action on 20 January withdrawing the US from the 2015 Paris agreement, along with a letter informing the United Nations of the decision.\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I am immediately withdrawing from the unfair, one-sided Paris Climate Accord rip-off\" Trump said during a rally at the Capital One Arena. In his inaugural speech, Trump said he would use executive action to \"end the Green New Deal\".\n\nWhat it means: In 2017, Trump exited the Paris agreement. Upon taking office in 2021, Biden rejoined. Monday's order makes good on a Trump election promise to withdraw from the 2015 global treaty seeking to avoid the worst impacts of the climate crisis.\n\nExiting the Paris agreement is part of Trump's broader efforts to roll back climate protections and policy. Trump has described Biden's efforts to grow the US's clean energy sector as \"the green new scam\".\n\nWhat Trump said: \"I guess I have a warm spot for TikTok that I didn't have originally,\" Trump said at the White House, as he signed executive orders, according to the New York Times.\n\nWhat it means: Trump ordered his attorney general to not enforce the law requiring TikTok's sale. Trump says the pause allows for time to chart an \"appropriate course forward\" to protect national security and not abruptly shut down the popular app. In his first term, Trump favored a TikTok ban, but has since changed his position due to factors including his own popularity on the app.",

            "body": "The Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruled last month that the definition of woman is determined by biological sex.\n\n\"Harry Potter\" actors are making their position on the trans debate clear in the wake of the historic Supreme Court of the United Kingdom ruling that the definition of a woman is determined by biological sex.\n\nSeveral celebrities from \"Harry Potter\" projects both past and present signed an open letter declaring their belief that the ruling was wrong.\n\nEddie Redmayne, star of the spin-off prequel franchise \"Fantastic Beasts,\" signed the letter, as did Paapa Essiedu, who will portray Severus Snape in the upcoming \"Harry Potter\" television adaptation from HBO. Katie Leung, an actress from the original films, also added her name to the document, per The Times of London.\n\n\"We the undersigned film and television professionals stand in solidarity with the trans, nonbinary and intersex communities who have been impacted by the Supreme Court ruling on April 16,\" the open letter says.\n\n\"We believe the ruling undermines the lived reality and threatens the safety of trans, non-binary and intersex people living in the UK,\" it said. \"Film and television are powerful tools for empathy and education, and we believe passionately in the ability of the screen to change hearts and minds. This is our opportunity to be on the right side of history.\"\n\nRedmayne, Essiedu, Leung and more than 2,000 other individuals added their names to the letter. Other celebrity signatories include \"The Last of Us\" star Bella Ramsey, \"The Brutalist\" actor and Taylor Swift's ex-boyfriend Joe Alwyn, and \"Bridgerton\" actress Nicola Coughlan.\n\nMeanwhile, Rowling, who has been openly critical of the radical trans agenda for years, has been celebrating the Supreme Court ruling as a great victory.\n\n\"Think I might be having a cigar later,\" Rowling shared on X April 16 after the ruling was handed down.\n\n\"It took three extraordinary, tenacious Scottish women with an army behind them to get this case heard by the Supreme Court and, in winning, they've protected the rights of women and girls across the UK,\" the billionaire \"Harry Potter\" author wrote in a follow-up later. \"I'm so proud to know you.\"\n\nLeftist fans and trans activists were furious that Rowling would be involved in the upcoming TV adaptation, but HBO released a statement last fall confirming she would be involved despite the backlash.\n\n\"We are proud to once again tell the story of Harry Potter -- the heartwarming books that speak to power of friendship, resolve and acceptance,\" the statement said. \"J.K. Rowling has a right to express her personal views. We will remain focused on the development of the new series, which will only benefit from her involvement.\"",

            "title": "David Horowitz: The Most Effective Conservative Of His Generation",
            "body": "I knew David really, really well. I used to work at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.\n\nTruth Revolt, which was a precursor to The Daily Wire, began at the David Horowitz Freedom Center.\n\nI knew David for more than a decade before that. He was truly a formative person in the modern conservative movement, a person who spoke the truth no matter the cost.\n\nDavid started off as a radical communist. He wrote a book in 1996 titled \"Radical Son: A Generational Odyssey.\" In it, he talks about how his parents were communists and that he was a \"Red Diaper Baby.\"\n\nHe began his career as a far-Left writer for Ramparts magazine. He turned to the Right when his friend was allegedly killed by the Black Panthers. Then, basically all of his old friends disowned him and decided he was \"untouchable.\"\n\nDavid then turned into one of the most effective conservative activists of his generation. He used to call the David Horowitz Freedom Center a \"battle tank\" rather than a think tank. Pretty much everybody who's anybody in modern conservatism had some initial connection with David Horowitz. I met Charlie Kirk, for example, at a David Horowitz Freedom Center event back when Charlie was maybe 18- or 19- years old and was first getting started with TPUSA.\n\nAnd that remains true for a huge number of people who got their start in the conservative movement in the 1990s and 2000s. His books are worth reading. He was really an amazing writer, a terrific speaker, and a strong voice.\n\nHorowitz: Will you condemn Hamas here and now?\n\nRadical Student: I'm sorry, what?\n\nHorowitz: Will you condemn Hamas? Will you condemn Hamas as a terrorist and genocidal organization?\n\nRadical Student: Are you asking me to put myself on a cross?\n\nHorowitz: So you won't. I actually have had this experience many times. You didn't read the pamphlet because the pamphlet is chapter and verse. The main connection is that the MSA is part of the Muslim Brotherhood network, as revealed in the document.\n\nRadical Student: I don't think you understood what I meant by that. I meant if I say something, I'm sure that I will be arrested for reasons of Homeland Security. So if you could please just answer my question.\n\nHorowitz: If you condemn Hamas, Homeland Security will arrest you?\n\nRadical Student: If I support Hamas -- because your question forces me to condemn Hamas -- if I support Hamas, I look really bad.\n\nHorowitz: Well, if you don't condemn Hamas, obviously you support it. Case closed. I've had this experience at UC Santa Barbara, where there were 50 members of the Muslim Students Association sitting right in the rows there. And throughout my hour talk, I kept asking them, \"Will you condemn Hezbollah and Hamas?\" And none of them would. And then when the question period came, the president of the Muslim Students Association was the first person to ask questions. I said, \"You know, before you start, will you condemn Hezbollah?\" And he said, \"Well, that question is too complicated for a yes or no answer.\" So I said, \"Okay, I'll put it to you this way. I'm a Jew. The head of Hezbollah has said that he hopes that we will gather in Israel so he doesn't have to hunt us down globally -- for it or against it?\n\nRadical Student: For it.\n\nHorowitz: Thank you. Thank you for coming and showing everybody what's here.\n\nDavid was extremely clear in his approach to the world. He understood the morality of many of our foreign adversaries. He was an advocate for Americanism and American strength and security. And he will very much be missed.",

            "body": "A sprawling estate on the shores of Lake Thonotosassa, just outside Tampa, Florida, is set to hit market for $23.6 million -- complete with a 900-square-foot replica of the Oval Office.\n\nBuilt in 2012 by the late healthcare entrepreneur Tom Simpson and his wife, June, the custom-designed property spans 22 acres and reflects the couple's distinct passions, from American history to Major League Baseball.\n\nThe oval-shaped room, which features a copy of the Resolute Desk and was decorated annually with official White House ornaments, was a particular source of joy for Tom, June Simpson told the Wall Street Journal, which first reported this listing.\n\n\"It was just something he wanted,\" she told the Journal. \"It made him happy.\"\n\nThe desk was previously used in the film \"National Treasure,\" she added.\n\nThe Simpsons, who sold their company Health Advocates to AmerisourceBergen for $83 million in 2006, acquired the Thonotosassa land in stages beginning around 2008.\n\nJune Simpson said the location appealed to them in part because of her interest in gardening, though much of the interior was tailored to Tom's extensive memorabilia collections.\n\nAmong the standout spaces is a baseball-themed room outfitted with a custom rug designed like a diamond, vintage Yankee Stadium seats and display cases for Tom's Atlanta Braves memorabilia.\n\nThe room, which cost about $150,000 to build, was a frequent gathering spot for events, hosting 30 to 40 people at a time.\n\nElsewhere in the home, a hallway known as the \"Walk of Fame\" showcases signed guitars used by performers like The Beach Boys and Aerosmith, along with floor plaques honoring celebrities the couple met, including Tom Hanks, Elton John, Lady Gaga and Cher.\n\nThe estate also includes an indoor lagoon with a waterfall and has hosted a variety of events, including one for the US Navy SEALs.\n\nDuring the occasion, June recalled how they pretended to kidnap her son and used dogs and simulated gunfire to stage a rescue.\n\n\"It was unbelievable,\" she said.\n\nAfter Tom passed away in 2024 at age 79 following a battle with Parkinson's disease, June decided to sell the home.\n\n\"Walking through this house, as beautiful as it is, it's got so many wonderful memories, but I just can't do it,\" she said. \"I just can't.\"\n\nThe property, which features six bedroom suites and 12 bathrooms, is listed by Karen L. Hegemeier and Paul DeSantis of Premier Sotheby's International Realty.\n\nIt can be purchased in its entirety or in two separate parcels: $18.9 million for the main residence on 14 acres and $4.7 million for the remaining 8 acres, which include a barn and greenhouse.\n\nIf sold at asking price, the home could surpass Tampa's current record residential sale -- Derek Jeter's $22.5 million transaction in 2021.\n\nHegemeier noted that luxury deals in the region have picked up recently as some affluent buyers seek a hedge against market volatility.\n\nWealthy buyers are paying all cash for real estate amid the stock market's unpredictability, Hegemeier said.",
