            "title": "The Greens say land-based salmon farming is viable. The Tasmanian industry says otherwise",
            "body": "Tasmania's salmon industry -- a $1.3 billion operation concentrated mostly in the state's south -- has become a contentious political topic this federal election campaign.\n\nIt produced almost 75,000 tonnes of Atlantic salmon in the 2022-23 financial year, and those in support of the industry argue it's an important economic contributor to the state, while providing employment to regional communities.\n\nThe industry, made up of three foreign-owned companies -- Tassal, Huon and Petuna -- has recently found itself at the centre of several environmental incidents, and has played a key role in a last-minute law change by Anthony Albanese's Labor government.\n\nNot long after, video released of live salmon being placed into bins with dead fish resulted in Huon losing its RSPCA certification.\n\nThe industry has been criticised by conservation and environmental groups for years over its impact on the endangered Maugean skate, a ray-like fish found only in Macquarie Harbour.\n\nTo mitigate the impacts to marine areas, environmental groups such as Neighbours of Fish Farming (NOFF) have argued that commercially-farmed salmon could be moved to land-based operations.\n\nThey say land-based farming also minimises the spread of disease, reducing the need for antibiotics, and removes noise and light pollution for coastal communities.\n\nIt's a strategy the salmon industry strongly opposes, arguing the move to 100 per cent land-based farming would be economically, logistically and politically unrealistic.\n\nThe push to land-based salmon farming\n\nIn Tasmania, commercially grown salmon starts in freshwater land-based hatcheries, before being moved to saltwater open-pen farms on maturity.\n\nLand-based farming uses Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), a controlled environment that reuses water and limits the movement of fish.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tasmanian Greens Senator Nick McKim announced a new policy to force salmon farms out of the state's coastal waters and in to land-based farms.\n\nThe Greens' proposal includes $50 million of Commonwealth funding for environmental remediation, independent monitoring of salmon farms for compliance with animal cruelty and environmental standards, and a \"jobs transition package\" for Macquarie Harbour workers.\n\nUnder the policy, the salmon industry would self-fund its transition to land-based farming.\n\nThe Greens have not put a timeline on the completion of the transition.\n\nTasmania's salmon industry is regulated by the state government.\n\nMr McKim said there were \"plenty of levers that can be pulled\" at a state level to instigate the transition.\n\n\"There's no doubt that the powers exist to transition the industry on shore and to force it to transition on shore,\" he said.\n\nThe Tasmanian government has not supported the Greens' policy.\n\nIndependent federal candidate for Franklin and Climate-200-backed anti-salmon campaigner, Peter George, has also flagged land-based aquaculture as an environmentally positive alternative.\n\nMr George took leave from his role as NOFF's president to challenge federal Fisheries Minister Julie Collins in the federal election.\n\nWhy the Tasmanian industry says it can't work\n\nLuke Martin, outgoing chief executive of the industry's peak body Salmon Tasmania, dismissed the case for 100-per-cent land-based farming as \"voodoo economics\".\n\n\"It will never get to a point where you do the entire production period, the entire two-year life cycle of the fish, on land,\" Mr Martin said.\n\nHe said large amounts of water, energy and land would be required to transition the industry, requirements he deemed unfeasible.\n\nMr Martin also argued that the cost of moving the industry to land-based farms was significant and would drive up the price of the product, making it economically unviable.\n\n\"We're talking about giant artificial ponds, enormous tanks built into the Tasmanian landscape -- which community would be lining up to put their hand up in Tasmania?\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said the industry was investigating how it could expand the amount of time fish spend on land before being transferred to marine pens -- with an eye to expanding operations.\n\n\"And then secure leases in deeper water, into more open water areas like outer Storm Bay, potentially off the coast.\"\n\nMr Martin said if land-based farming did become feasible, he believed the industry would move closer to bigger mainland markets to minimise costs.\n\nHas it worked elsewhere?\n\nOther commercially grown finfish, such as barramundi, are farmed at land-based facilities in Queensland and the Northern Territory at far smaller volumes than Atlantic salmon.\n\nInternationally, most industrial-scale salmon farming takes place in open-net pens out on the water.\n\nHowever, land-based commercial Atlantic salmon farms do exist, and have been implemented at small scale in many countries -- most notably in the US, Canada, Japan and Europe.\n\nThe scale of production at these land-based locations is far smaller than their ocean counterparts.\n\nThe largest example of land-based RAS aquaculture is Florida-based company, Atlantic Sapphire, which raises salmon in a \"bluehouse\", a climate-controlled indoor facility that minimises the risk of disease and environmental contamination.\n\nBut profitability remains a challenge.\n\nIn 2023, the company harvested just over 1,500 tonnes, a decrease of about 700 tonnes from the previous year.\n\nCanada is the world's fourth-largest producer of Atlantic salmon, with the majority of its industry farming in west coast waters off Vancouver Island in British Columbia.\n\nIt is attempting to transition part of its billion-dollar industry to land-based practices.\n\nIn June last year, the Canadian government promised to ban marine salmon farming in British Columbia by 2029, citing environmental concerns and the need to protect wild salmon populations.\n\nThe plan has left the region's peak-industry body, the British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association, concerned and doubtful it can be achieved without significant job losses.\n\nIts executive director, Brian Kingzett, told the ABC the estimated cost to transition the industry was more than 2 billion Canadian dollars.\n\n\"Much like Tasmania, we're largely a remote island. Our salmon farms are in rural areas, we don't have the power grid or the land to support on-land aquaculture.\"",

            "body": "The Duke of Sussex has well and truly flipped the script and is trying something completely new this year, leaving many agahst.\n\nWe love a mystery. A gone girl, a podcast, a true crime investigation, which is handy because we are faced with a Sherlockian puzzler that will require a magnifying glass and everyone bringing a packed lunch to try and solve.\n\nHave you noticed? Something strange and unusual of late? Something missing? A certain silence, a space, a void? A one time super glued-on fixture of news headlines, a mainstay of People covers and all round general thorn in the side of the British royal family?\n\nSo far, 2025 has to be the quietest year on record for the 40-year-old who appears to have vanished into the honeysuckled thin air of Montecito.\n\nThe royal father-of-two has, this year, seem to have become something of a comparative recluse, keeping his head firmly down.\n\nThere have been no denunciations of the press in interviews or speeches given on New York stages where, dark blue-suited, he passionately rails against the ills of social media or him, tan-blazered, raising funds for his mainstay charities.\n\nDitto, no polo, no red carpets, no TV projects, no books, no podcasts, no beachy holidays, no Katy Perry concerts, no private jets, no drinks at Ellen's place and no even being papped leaving a local Santa Barbara restaurant after putting away a T-bone.\n\nWe are living in a very strange Sussex-y time indeed.\n\nBy and large this year, the vast majority of the times the duke has been seen, it has been being one half of a double act with his wife Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex. In January the couple found themselves, wholly unfairly, at the centre of a bit of a s**tstorm after they turned up to lend a hand during the LA fires before Harry, very much on the down low, occasionally popped up to thank first responders.\n\nHe also made a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance at One805's Rock for Responders\n\nfundraiser in LA.\n\nIn February, for one week, it was High Wattage Harry A-Go-Go at the Invictus Games in Vancouver.\n\nIn March he earned himself not even an IMDB credit with a cameo in the final episode of his wife's generally critically panned With Love, Meghan playing his favourite role, beamingly adoring husband.\n\nIn April he flew to London to attend court where he is legally challenging what is technically his father's government over his security arrangements, having lost his automatic police protection in 2020.\n\nLast week, we got another chance to really prove he's the world's proudest Wife Guy when he played supportive plus one when the duchess spoke at the TIME100 Summit in New York.\n\nAlso during that trip, the Sussexes unveiled the Lost Screen Memorial which remembers 50 young people who have lost their lives due to harms of social media.\n\nHarry, as far as I can tell, has not done a day of publicly facing paid work. Despite being the Chief Impact Officer of coaching platform BetterUp he did not appear at their recent Uplift Summit, an event he spoke at for the previous four years.\n\nWe are at least 120 days into 2025 so far and Harry has been seen on fewer of them than there have been UFO sightings in New Jersey. (Because where else would the alien invasion begin but in the birthplace of disco fries and Danny DeVito?)\n\nNever has there been a time in the last two decades, by and large, that the world has seen so little of the Duke of Sussex.\n\nHas Harry, I wonder, pulled off something truly extraordinary - by and large is this the shockingly quiet, peaceful life he always dreamed about? Where he can do Dad things like pickups and drop offs and where no one is busy defining him as the Boy Who Will Never Be King?\n\nAfter all, he has told his story, cashed the cheques and, maybe, given up on expectantly waiting by the phone for his father King Charles to stutter out some sort of half-hearted 'sorry' over the yapping of the Jack Russells.\n\nThat's one view. Another is that, five years on from Megxit, the Duke of Sussex's life has ended up in something of a cul-de-sac.\n\nLast month he revealed he was 'heartbroken' to have parted ways with Sentebale, the charity that he and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho co-founded nearly 20 years ago, the duo along with the rest of the trustees having resigned in protest over chairwoman Dr Sophie Chandauka. Dr Chandauka has accused Harry and the organisation of \"bullying and harassment at scale\".\n\nThe UK's Charity Commission is currently investigating concerns about the Sentebale.\n\nI'm absolutely sure that Harry does a hell of a lot of work behind the scenes for the Invictus and the Sussexes' Archewell Foundation's projects, we are a hell of long way off the 152 engagements, at least, that he clocked up in his final full year of official royal life in 2019.\n\nThe interesting contrast here is that Harry appears to have withdrawn from view while Meghan is more out there and in the limiest of lights, appearing on podcasts (her own and a friend's), being interviewed by the New York Times, debuting her Netflix show, launching her As Ever range of food products and posting, posting, posting over on Instagram.\n\nAs anyone who lives near a fault line knows, the thing to do in an earthquake is \"duck and cover\". Who knew he would seemingly take it so very literally?",

Chuck Schumer's \"very strongly worded\" letter that he sent to President Trump demanding answers on Harvard's federal funding freeze - taking a sarcastic jab at the supposedly tough, \"shake in your boots\" missive.\n\nDuring an appearance Wednesday on \"The Late Show,\" the former White House press secretary warned that if Democrats keep using washed-up strategies instead of fighting back, they'll lose another election.\n\n\"But Chuck Schumer, he wrote a very strongly worded letter,\" host Stephen Colbert joked.\n\n\"With eight strongly worded questions,\" Psaki chimed in.\n\nColbert added, \"What more could you ask of a leader?\"\n\n\"If that's not going to make you shake in your boots, I don't know what is,\" Psaki continued.\n\nShe's just the latest to ridicule Schumer's tactic, last week sending a letter, along with four other Jewish senators, demanding Trump immediately reverse course on his attacks against Harvard.\n\nThe federal government has frozen more than $2.2 billion in grants and $60 million in contracts to the university over pro-Palestinian campus protests.\n\nPsaki argued that Democratic lawmakers need to take a more aggressive approach to their GOP counterparts.\n\n\"Go lead a protest. Go to a red state. Go hold a town hall. Go to El Salvador, whatever it may be,\" Psaki said on the late-night show.\n\n\"People want to know you're fighting and doing things. If Democrats are going to rely on the tactics of old, they will lose, and so hopefully more people come onto the fighting side,\" she continued.\n\nShe nodded to Gov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, who over the weekend called for \"mass protests, for mobilization, for disruption.\"\n\n\"It was incredibly powerful, incredibly strong,\" Psaki said. \"The message he was sending was, 'I'm a fighter.

            "title": "Wikipedia Editors Melt Down over U.S. Attorney Ed Martin Accusing Site of Political Bias",
            "body": "After Acting U.S. Attorney for D.C. Ed Martin sent a letter last week to the foundation that owns Wikipedia raising questions regarding the online encyclopedia's political bias, editors made repeated attacks against Martin on the site. Editors also attacked Wikipedia co-founder Larry Sanger and Elon Musk due to their criticism of the site's left-wing bias.\n\nSome editors suggested Wikipedia respond to the letter by imposing a temporary blackout of the site as happened when protesting copyright laws they deemed too restrictive. Others suggested moving the site's servers or the Wikimedia Foundation itself outside the United States.\n\nMartin's letter cited concerns about Wikipedia's political bias and foreign actors pushing propaganda. Discussion of Martin's letter began at the discussion page for Wikipedia co-founder Jimmy Wales. Although Wales has lost many of his privileges on Wikipedia, he remains a member of the Foundation's board of trustees. Multiple editors, including an admin who was formerly part of the site's Arbitration Committee akin to a Supreme Court, suggested the site's Foundation owners say \"fuck off\" or \"fuck off Nazi\" as their official response.\n\nCriticism also focused on Martin's requests to the Foundation showing a misunderstanding of the group's role in governing Wikipedia. However, while the Foundation largely avoided interfering with the community previously, in recent years it has imposed a left-wing \"code of conduct\" on all Foundation-owned sites like Wikipedia, though enforcement is largely delegated to volunteers. Prior attempts at more direct enforcement of policy have prompted editor revolts. Although there were also suggestions Martin raised legitimate concerns, many editors insisted Martin's concerns were not genuine and his objection was \"facts\" on Wikipedia contradicted his and the Trump Administration's views with their intention being to intimidate and co-opt the site.\n\nEditors in a wider community discussion launched into attacks on Martin. Administrator \"Voorts\" called Martin a \"clown\" in a hostile rant. Several editors followed up by making other attacks with administrator \"Llywrch\" claiming \"those around the short-fingered convicted felon\" were either clowns or incompetent hacks along with other incendiary political statements. Yet another editor responded to this stating they, including Martin, were \"killer clowns\" and \"literally supporting more than one genocide\" at the moment. Editor \"Cambalachero\" commented in the middle of this discussion to note that Wikipedia's policies on claims about living people still apply in the discussion, though none of the editors modified their remarks.\n\nAdministrator \"Bishonen\" wryly suggested creating a Wikipedia article about the letter itself. Her comments unfavorably referenced an Indian court case against the Foundation and how an article created about the court case had to be pulled down on the order of the court, while suggesting an article about Martin's letter would more likely stay up. Bishonen has previously used her privileges to favor left-wing editors on the violent far-left Antifa group and the GamerGate anti-corruption movement in gaming.\n\nMartin's Wikipedia page was also vandalized shortly after the letter's release by non-account users calling him a \"Nazi\" and a \"cuckold\" with another labeling him \"far-right\" repeatedly before an admin, a user with special privileges, locked the page so only registered accounts over a few days old with multiple edits could edit. However, the \"far-right\" label was soon added back by an admitted Trump critic who added a paragraph labeling Martin a \"conspiracy theorist\" citing blogs and opinion pieces, despite such sourcing violating policy and the label was also added to the first sentence of Martin's article.\n\nOne editor added negative material about Martin's involvement in a leadership battle over the conservative Eagle Forum founded by Phyllis Schlafly, without noting any material from the source describing members of the Schlafly family supporting Martin's position and defending his conduct. Another editor added a line to the first paragraph of the article stating Martin \"has a history of making incendiary claims about opponents and causing ethical and legal controversies\" citing a single ProPublica article, which itself sourced its statement to a piece at left-wing Media Matters.\n\nWhen an editor attempted to remove several labels attacking Martin from the first paragraph of his page, editor Paul Lee, who edits as \"Valjean\" on Wikipedia and is an obsessively anti-Trump editor, restored them. Administrator \"Zzuzz\" later removed the \"conspiracy theorist\" label, but the \"far-right\" label was restored by Bishonen after another editor removed that label citing a paragraph that had exactly one source using the label. Site policy is that articles on people should avoid contentious terms in the first sentence in favor of those widely used in sources deemed reliable on Wikipedia.\n\nSite co-founder Larry Sanger also was targeted as a result of the opening post in the community discussion stating he was \"involved\" in the letter. Sanger was merely mentioned for his criticisms of Wikipedia, but several editors attacked Sanger as complicit in Martin's letter with one editor calling him extreme and dismissing as \"ridiculous\" his criticisms of the site's left-wing bias. Previously, Sanger has been smeared by Wikipedia editors over his criticism of the site.\n\nMultiple editors suggested there was some credibility to the criticism or concern in the discussion, but this often received a hostile response from other editors. When Cambalachero suggested responding seriously to Martin, another editor insisted the letter was \"intimidation by a government that does not like press freedom, free speech, academic liberty, sciences, and more broadly knowledge.\"\n\nCambalachero criticized the suggestion of there being a conspiracy to silence Wikipedia, but several editors objected with one arguing Musk along with others were trying to silence Wikipedia, though deferred on whether it was a conspiracy. Editor Andy Mabbett insisted a conspiracy existed with Musk specifically identified as involved along with the Heritage Foundation. As evidence against Musk, he merely cited an article about Musk criticizing Wikipedia for negatively-slanted edits about him and general issues of political bias. Mabbett has served as a \"Wikipedian in Residence\" at numerous research institutions and universities and organized various editing events at others.\n\nRegarding the Heritage Foundation, which has been alleged to be looking to uncover the real identities of editors engaged in antisemitic editing, Cambalachero said its goal was sympathetic. However, several editors objected that it was not about antisemitism with editor \"Viriditas\" insisting Republicans do not care about Jews and comparing Jews who support Republicans to \"kapos in Nazi-era WWII who helped their fellow Jews to their deaths\" in concentration camps.\n\n\"North8000\" suggested they \"create and publicize initiatives to find systemic fixes\" to Wikipedia's bias on politics to address criticism. Some editors were sympathetic to the suggestion, but editor \"Simonm223\" criticized the idea by claiming \"the far-right\" wants Wikipedia's \"submission\" rather than neutrality. He further argued Wikipedia has a \"center-right\" bias, a claim previously used by the main Wikipedia community newsletter to dismiss left-wing bias claims, and that a \"neutral encyclopedia would be more critical of the Trump regime\" than Wikipedia is now. Simonm223 is a self-identified socialist that previously praised an Antifa terrorist who attacked an ICE detention facility during Trump's first term.\n\nSome editors in the discussion suggested counter-measures to evade any legal response by Martin such as moving the Wikipedia servers or the Foundation itself to another country, though many editors raised concern about which countries would allow them the same degree of freedom they currently enjoy. Other editors suggested decentralizing the site's fundraising efforts across multiple countries. Wales expressed his view in the discussion that pressure from the United States was not a serious vulnerability.\n\nVictor Grigas, a former Wikimedia Foundation staffer, suggested a \"blackout\" of the site as a protest similar to actions taken in response to copyright laws editors deemed too restrictive, though other editors were resistant. When an editor in that discussion suggested the Foundation might take steps to comply with Martin's concerns and \"threaten Wikipedia freedomness and neutral point of view\" in the process, Wales responded by rejecting the idea and referred to Martin's letter as an attack arguing \"when being attacked, one of the thing that the attackers usually want is for the attackees to turn on each other for no reason. We can be unified because we are unified.\"\n\nWikipedia has come under increasing scrutiny due to its apparent left-wing bias as identified in numerous studies. Part of the scrutiny has focused on the online encyclopedia's sourcing policies and its purging of conservative media. The site has been increasingly relied on by Big Tech platforms and praised by corporate media who have even copied its contents as with Wikipedia's extremely biased article on GamerGate. Such reliance comes in spite of Wikipedia's long history of spreading hoaxes and issues with paid editing. The Wikimedia Foundation's promotion of Wikipedia as a solution to \"fake news\" came after the firm run by the Clinton Foundation's Communications leader suggested the strategy.\n\n(Disclosure: The author has previously been involved in disputes on Wikipedia with some parties referenced in this article)",

            "body": "This week in Newly Reviewed, Holland Cotter covers Sheyla Baykal's downtown stars, a group show from a radical feminist art collective and Young Joon Kwak's quieter side.\n\nSheyla Baykal\n\nThrough May 10. Soft Network, 636 Broadway; 917-803-3620, softnetwork.art.\n\nIn the New York City art world in the 1960s, '70s and even early '80s, the descriptive terms \"downtown\" and \"underground\" were pretty much synonymous. The photographer Sheyla Baykal (1944-1997) was a vital inhabitant of that terrain, and one of its underrecognized visual historians.\n\nNow, largely thanks to the attention of another veteran avant-garde citizen -- the performance artist Penny Arcade, who has preserved Baykal's material legacy -- we have a thrilling view into those decades in an exhibition at Soft Network, a gallery devoted to preserving artists' estates.\n\nBorn in the United States and raised in Turkey, Baykal was herself a sought-after photographic subject as a Ford agency fashion model in the 1960s. But she also carried a camera of her own and had it trained on the New York's art scene. Through a family connection she had entree into the Abstract Expressionist circles of an earlier day; Willem and Elaine de Kooning, well along in years, were among her subjects.\n\nHer focus, though, was a new, venturesome, primarily gay world of performance-intensive art, and her photos give us an archival treasury of images. She documented the extravagant theatrics of West Coast hippie drag collectives like the Cockettes and the Angels of Light, and the New York performer and filmmaker Jack Smith.\n\nBaykal eventually came to favor portraiture as a genre. And some of the most radical talents associated with Manhattan's pre-gentrified East Village scene sat for her: Bette Bourne of Bloolips fame; the performance-art dream team of Ethyl Eichelberger and Agosto Machado; the genius installation artist Paul Thek; and the photographer laureate of the underground, Peter Hujar (his ineffable 1976 book, \"Portraits in Life and Death,\" has recently been republished by Liveright).\n\nAIDS and age have taken most of these beings from us, but they all appear in the Soft Network exhibition of Baykal photographs, videos and ephemera organized by the art historian Marcelo Gabriel Yáñez with Penny Arcade. And at a time when, by presidential order, all things L.G.B.T.Q. are being officially whited out from the record, Baykal and her subjects glow like the art-firmamental stars they were, and are.\n\nNancy Brooks Brody, Joy Episalla, Zoe Leonard and Carrie Yamaoka\n\nThrough May 11. Participant, Inc., 116 Elizabeth Street; 646-492-4076, participantinc.org.\n\nThis small, grave, beautiful show brings together work by four of the founding members of Fierce Pussy, a radical lesbian feminist art collective. It also stands as a memorial to one of its members, the much-missed Nancy Brooks Brody, who died in 2023.\n\nThe collective emerged in 1991 as an offshoot of the activist group ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). It focused attention particularly on the effects of the AIDS epidemic on women, and did so through the production of street-level, no-budget forms of protest art like wheat-pasted posters and guerrilla-style actions.\n\nThe Participant exhibition, organized by Jo-ey Tang, begins with a reminder of this history at the gallery entrance, with a stack of takeaway posters emblazoned with the phrase \"I got all my sisters with me\" (a quote from the 1979 Sister Sledge song \"We Are Family\"). But the show itself is about the individual work of the four founding artists, much of which seems to be addressing the vulnerability of art itself, and particularly of art by queer women, in a hostile culture.\n\nZoe Leonard's photograph of a gnarled city tree pushing through fencing reads as a cleareyed, poetic study in struggle. So does a floor piece by Carrie Yamaoka composed of fabric remnants of a ruined couch or bed, but with all the textile fragments neatly folded so as to look precious, not abject, or maybe both. Similarly, Joy Episalla's large sculpture made of creased and crumpled photographic paper comes across both as fodder for a compactor and as a bold statement of anti-monumentalism.\n\nAnd a few modest-size works by Brody suggest why she is so missed. One, a black-and-white painting of wavy lines, carries the gritty title of \"Glory Hole\" but looks like an ethereal Agnes Martin grid shimmying and dancing. A sculpture consisting of two small triangular strips of black metal embedded high up in a gallery wall almost escapes detection but, once noticed, grips, the eye and mind: Is it meant to suggest a wound? An ornament? A surveillance device? It's a lesson in how, in the right hands, \"not much\" can fire questions in every direction and be absolutely, powerfully there.\n\nYoung Joon Kwak\n\nThrough July 27. Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, 26 Wooster Street; 212-431-2609, leslielohman.org.\n\nBorn in Queens in 1984 and now based in Los Angeles, the artist Young Joon Kwak, who is Korean American and transgender, covers a lot of ground media-wise. A sculptor and video artist, they co-founded an electronic-dance-noise band called Xina Xurner in 2011; they were, and are, the rousing lead singer. A year later, in Los Angeles, Kwak turned their studio into a communal space called the Mutant Salon, where queer, trans and femme-based projects could be developed.\n\nMuch of this work was visually and aurally raucous. But the Leslie-Lohman show -- organized by Stamatina Gregory, the museum's head curator -- is the opposite: spare, quiet. A large, seemingly abstract recent ceramic sculpture called \"Femmes (Nic, Toria, Tala)\" is a cast of the embracing bodies of three nonbinary friends. Another work, \"Veil (Lulu),\" is made from a pair of glitter-coated ceramic arms and hands open in a gesture of benedictory welcome. A third, \"Divine Ruin (Stamatina and Young),\" is in the form of what appears to be two overlapped faces encrusted with glistening rhinestones. All are images of joining, unity, community.\n\nAnother version of \"Divine Ruin,\" this one a self-portrait of the artist, is in an exhibition called \"The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture\" at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art in Washington. That show has been singled out for condemnation in one of the recent presidential executive orders that have accused cultural institutions of promoting divisive \"ideology\" around the subjects of gender and race.\n\nSo, in the spirit of timeliness, let me recommend three additional New York exhibitions that keep the spark of Resisterhood burning. The group show \"Ficciones Patógenas,\" also at Leslie-Lohman, addresses the torturous history of Indigenous gender diversity under European colonialism in the Americas. For \"Deviations\" at James Fuentes, the artist Oscar yi Hou has assembled, pretty much on the fly, a survey of his downtown-ish artist-friends, most of them trans or gay. And P.P.O.W. has the first New York solo show in 15 years of the Cuban-born painter Manuel Pardo (1952-2012). He was a fixture of the East Village art world of the 1980s, who, with his early nude self-portraits and later images of his imperiously glam mother, deserves a hero's welcome back to town.\n\nSee the April gallery shows here.",
