            "body": "The impact of young voters on the election will become clear after polling day on May 3.\n\nThey're disillusioned, resentful and many suspect the system is rigged against them.\n\nFor the first time, Gen Z and millennial voters outnumber baby boomers at the federal election -- and most of them aren't reaching the same milestones as their parents.\n\nMore than 7 million Australians have already cast their vote ahead of Saturday, and despite a campaign largely shaped by the rising cost of living and housing, it's unclear whether young voters feel satisfied by what's on offer.\n\nPolitical analysts say their grievances could deliver unexpected results in marginal seats.\n\nA widening wealth gap\n\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor in politics at Monash University, said generational inequality could be driving \"unpredictable\" voting patterns among Gen Zs and millennials.\n\n\"They're not reaching the sort of milestones that previous generations did, such as home ownership, marrying [and] having children,\" Dr Strangio said.\n\n\"Those things used to predispose people to becoming more conservative in their outlook.\"\n\nAustralia's birth rate recently hit an all-time low, and government data shows today's 30-34 year-olds are the first age group in more than 47 years where most people don't own a house.\n\nUNSW economics professor Richard Holden said while many young voters earn higher incomes today than their parents did at their age, it was now much harder to build wealth through property ownership.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's rising intergenerational income inequality, but there's a good case to worry about wealth inequality,\" he said.\n\n\"And I'd say that aspect is getting worse.\"\n\nTim Harcourt, an economist at the University of Technology Sydney, agreed the wealth disparity between generations was becoming increasingly acute.\n\n\"It's really starting to bite now as the Baby Boomers retire into their defined benefits superannuation schemes and extra properties,\" he said.\n\n\"I think housing is a red button issue ... and that's where the youth reaction will be really important.\"\n\nYoung voters 'a ticking time bomb'\n\nDr Strangio said voters typically became more conservative as they grew older, but now they're skewing further to the left and feeling increasingly dissatisfied with the major parties.\n\n\"Young voters are a ticking time bomb,\" he said.\n\n\"They're facing real wage declines, high costs for education, difficulty in getting into the housing market and yet so far I think they've been quiet tolerant.\"\n\nBut he warned their patience wouldn't last forever.\n\n\"When we look overseas to places like Trump's America, young men are being attracted to aggressive, populist policies because of inequalities,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's a warning that we do need to address those things with some urgency because we don't want to see those sorts of trends.\"\n\nProfessor Harcourt said while the youth vote typically skewed to the left in inner-city electorates, voting patterns would be harder to predict among tradies or factory workers in rural areas.\n\n\"It's quite unpredictable in the outer suburbs where there's housing stress and population stress, where there is a view that the infrastructure is not keeping up with the population growth,\" he said.\n\nClimate change remains a concern\n\nAside from housing affordability and the cost of living, a new YouGov poll suggests young voters remain deeply concerned about the impacts of climate change.\n\nEarlier this year, Australians' social media accounts lit up with videos of wildfires ripping through Los Angeles and damage from Tropical Cyclone Alfred in parts of Queensland and New South Wales.\n\nAccording to the YouGov poll, four-in-five young voters said climate change would influence their vote in the federal election.\n\nThe poll of 1,622 adult Australian voters, commissioned by Solutions for Climate Australia, found 79 per cent of Gen Zs and 73 per cent of millennials said climate change was an important part of their decision-making at the polling booth.\n\nAbout 67 per cent of undecided voters also said climate change was important in determining their vote.\n\nAustralian Youth Climate Coalition national director Grace Vegesana said the issue wasn't going away.\n\n\"Young people under 40 do deeply care about the climate crisis and if they're not seeing solutions ... they will vote accordingly.\"\n\nShe said many young voters reported feeling left behind this election.\n\n\"We are going to see a shift away from the major parties as people realise [we] want to see ambition, and not just be handed baseline policies that continue business as usual,\" she said.",

            "title": "Your guide to major parties' key policies",
            "body": "Australians across the nation are set to head to the polling booths to decide who will lead the nation for the next three years.\n\nThroughout a rapid election campaign period, the parties have revealed (and sometimes rolled back) their policies on key issues such as health, the cost of living, housing, energy, defence, migration, crime and Indigenous affairs.\n\nTo help you decide who gets your vote, we've compiled a quick guide outlining the major policies on key issues from Labor, the Coalition and the Greens.\n\nHealth\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Albanese government's flagship campaign promise was $8.5bn to deliver an additional 18 million bulk-billed GP visits each year if re-elected. The Labor government also pledged a cap of $25 per prescription for medicines covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Both of these policies were matched by the Coalition. The Coalition will also match Labor's $575m plan to add oral contraceptives, menopause hormone therapies, endometriosis and IVF drugs to the PBS.\n\nLabor: In addition to the above policies, Labor pledged a $1bn boost for headspace clinics and specialist centres for youth, $644m for 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, and $16.7m to bolster mental health support services for new parents.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has promised a $5m review of women-specific items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS, $500m to raise Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20, $400m for youth mental health and a $15m boost to the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund.\n\nGreens: The Greens also support an expansion of Medicare but at a far greater level. They have pledged $195bn to Medicare to expand the system to include dental and extended mental health support.\n\nCost of living\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Coalition has backed Labor's position to freeze the alcohol excise on draught beer for two years, starting from August 1, 2025. Both parties have also agreed to extend energy bill rebates for all households until the end of 2025, saving $150 per household at a cost of $1.8bn.\n\nLabor: Effective from June 1, 2025, the Labor government will implement a 20 per cent reduction on all student loan debts, including HELP, VET Student Loans and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans. A re-elected Labor government would introduce an instant $1000 tax deduction for work-related expenses, and tax breaks announced during the federal budget for those in the lowest bracket would be made permanent.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged a one-time tax offset of up to $1200 for workers earning up to $144,000. If elected, the Coalition would cut the fuel excise in half for 12 months starting in July, but it would repeal the changes that give people in the lowest bracket a tax break.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to make all public transport cost 50c, wipe all student debt and provide universal mental health care with unlimited sessions.\n\nHousing\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both have promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from buying existing homes for two years and have ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\nLabor: Labor will expand its Homes for Australia plan to build an extra 100,000 homes specifically for first-time buyers, and all first-home buyers will be eligible for 5 per cent deposits.\n\nCoalition: TheCoalition will allow first-home buyers to take 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to $50,000, for a home deposit. First-home buyers of new properties will be able to claim the interest paid on the first $650,000 of a mortgage as a tax deduction. The Coalition has also vowed to maintain the Home Guarantee Scheme program, which includes a 5 per cent deposit program for first-homebuyers, and a 2 per cent deposit scheme for single parents or eligible single legal guardians with at least one dependent.\n\nGreens: The Greens will phase out tax handouts for property investors with more than one investment property by scrapping the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. They also pledge to limit rent increases to 2 per cent every two years.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both Labor and the Coalition have committed to a $10m investment in a new Bureau of Meteorology weather radar for regional Queensland.\n\nLabor: Labor will slash the cost of solar battery installations by up to $4000 per household from July 1 and extend the energy bill rebate until the end of the year, saving households $150. Labor will also aim to source 82 per cent of the electricity grid from renewables by 2030.\n\nCoalition: One of the Liberal Party's flagship policies is its nuclear plan. A Coalition government will build seven government-owned nuclear reactors co-located alongside retiring coal-fired generators by 2050, with the first two smaller generators in operation by 2035. Under a Coalition government, the energy mix will be 54 per cent renewables, 33 per cent nuclear, with the remaining 13 per cent battery storage and gas.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to block all new coal and gas projects. The Greens' climate and energy plan includes expanding the Net Zero Economy Authority to support all fossil fuel workers and invest $10bn in clean industries and infrastructure in transitioning regions.\n\nDefence\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have pledged to regain ownership of the Port of Darwin.\n\nLabor: Labor has pledged at least $50.3bn into defence over the next decade, with Anthony Albanese leaving the door open to further increases. An additional $262m has been allocated to bolster local defence industries and develop Australia's nuclear-powered submarine supply chain under the AUKUS partnership.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition's flagship defence policy is a $21bn boost to the defence budget over the next five years, pushing total military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The Coalition has pledged to speed up the AUKUS submarine agreement, though it has not detailed how.\n\nThe Greens: The Greens have pledged to withdraw from the AUKUS political pact and renegotiate Australia's position in the ANZUS treaty. As a result, the Greens would attempt to stop the $375bn purchase of AUKUS nuclear submarines.\n\nMigration\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have announced they will increase the cost of student visa applications. The Coalition pledged to triple the cost of student visa applications to $5000 (up from $1600), while a re-elected Labor government would increase the cost of student visa applications to $2000.\n\nLabor: Labor has been relatively silent on the issue of migration but canned the Coalition's policies as \"savage\".\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged to reduce the permanent migration intake by 25 per cent. The cuts would target those on skilled visas in an effort to lower permanent migration from 185,000 in 2024-25 to 140,000 in 2025-26. Mr Dutton has also said the party would slash the number of international students by 80,000. The Coalition has also made a commitment to reduce the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.\n\nGreens: The Greens want to expand Australia's humanitarian intake to 50,000 places per year and create additional places via a new private humanitarian sponsorship program.\n\nCrime\n\nLabor: Labor has promised $157m over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco and $8.6m ï\"¿in funding for management of domestic violence perpetrators. It has pledged to take steps to prevent domestic violence perpetrators from using the tax and corporate systems to create debts as a form of coercive control.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition announced a $750m package to tackle crime across the nation. Dubbed \"Operation Safer Communities\", the Opposition Leader's plan would implement a national drug strike team and a 12-month pilot of a National Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme. The Coalition has also pledged $90m to tackle domestic violence, including implementing a National Domestic Violence Register to ensure police and relevant agencies can share information about violent offenders.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to fund the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children with $12n over 12 years. They have also earmarked $3.3m for a national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to help people who may be at risk of domestic violence to find out if their current or former partner has a history of violent criminal offences.\n\nIndigenous affairs\n\nLabor: Labor has broadly committed to a continuation of efforts to close the gap. It has promised an extra $5mn towards pre-existing plans for a TAFE Centre of Excellence with hubs in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and $77m towards sea wall and wastewater infrastructure in the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has vowed to establish a royal commission into allegations of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities and reintroduce compulsory income management via the Cashless Debit Card.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged $250 to establish a National Truth and Justice Commission to acknowledge and document historic and ongoing injustices. They will also introduce a federal Act to protect First Nations cultural heritage.",

            "title": "Dozens of homeless people living in national forest evicted by US Forest Service",
            "body": "Service closing area in Oregon for wildfire prevention plan months after Trump order to increase timber production\n\nDozens of homeless people who have been living in a national forest in central Oregon for years were being evicted on Thursday by the US Forest Service, as it closed the area for a wildfire prevention project that will involve removing smaller trees, clearing debris and setting controlled burns over thousands of acres.\n\nThe project has been on the books for years, and the decision to remove the encampment in the Deschutes national forest comes two months after the Trump administration issued an executive order directing federal agencies to increase timber production and forest management projects aimed at reducing wildfire risk. It wasn't immediately clear if the evictions were a result of that order, but homeless advocates seized on the timing on Thursday, as US Forest Service officers blocked the access road.\n\n\"The fact that they are doing this with such vigor shortly after they announced that the forests would be opened up for logging I don't think is a coincidence,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture, which oversees the US Forest Service, and the service's Pacific Northwest Region did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\n\"The closure does not target any specific user group and will restrict all access, including day use and overnight camping, while crews operate heavy machinery, conduct prescribed burns, and clean up hazardous materials,\" Deschutes national forest spokesperson Kaitlyn Webb said in an email. \"It's not safe for the public to be in the area while heavy machinery is operating, trees are being felled, mowing operations are active, and prescribed burning is occurring.\"\n\nCampers who had set up trailers, recreational vehicles and tents amidst the ponderosa pines in the Deschutes national forest scrambled in the darkness Wednesday night to pack up and get their engines working again. Authorities closed the two-lane road in the early hours of Thursday morning, and it was not immediately clear how many people were left in the forest by the afternoon, though some were unable to leave.\n\nThe US Forest Service has been working for years on plans to close part of the Deschutes national forest near Bend for forest restoration and wildfire mitigation. But the number of people living in that part of the forest has grown, with many losing homes during the coronavirus pandemic due to job losses and high housing costs, Rabinowitz said.\n\nDonald Trump's administration has acted to roll back environmental safeguards around future logging projects on more than half of US national forests, under an emergency designation that cites dangers from wildfires.\n\nWhether the administration's move will boost lumber supplies as Trump envisioned in an executive order he signed in March remains to be seen. Joe Biden's administration also sought more logging in public forests to combat fires, which have become more intense amid drier and hotter conditions linked to the climate crisis, yet US Forest Service timber sales stayed relatively flat under his tenure.\n\nThe Cabin Butte Vegetation Management Project, a wildfire mitigation treatment on some 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares), is prompting the closures in the Deschutes national forest.\n\nThe goal of the work is to reduce wildfire risk and restore damaged habitats where development encroaches on natural areas near Bend, Deschutes national forest officials said in a statement. Recreation sites and trails in that area will be closed through April next year.\n\nMultiple US Forest Service officials and vehicles were stationed at the Deschutes national forest road closure on Thursday. A sign on the metal gate blocking the road said the temporary emergency closure will last at least one year.\n\nViolators could face up six months in jail, fines up to $5,000, or both.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mandy Bryant, who said she had lived in the encampment for about three years, was cleaning up her site and trying to get a trailer to start so she could move it.\n\n\"You could feel the heaviness in the air and just the stress and depression that people are feeling,\" she told the Associated Press. \"We're up there on the list of groups of people that society doesn't really care for.\"\n\nFour people living in the encampment including Bryant, along with two homeless advocates, filed for a restraining order to stop the closure earlier this month. The claim argued it would cause irreparable harm to more than 100 people who were living there, many of whom have disabilities.\n\nThe government responded in court filings that US Forest Service staff in January began notifying homeless people living in the area of the upcoming closure. Original plans for the project were published in 2019 and were authorized by the US Forest Service in 2023, the court filings said.\n\nUS district court judge Michael McShane denied the restraining order on Tuesday and issued a written opinion on Thursday.\n\n\"The public's significant interest in restoring natural habitats, preventing catastrophic wildfires, and preserving the overall health of Deschutes National Forest is not outweighed by the interest of 150 or so individuals in residing on this particular plot of land,\" he wrote in his ruling.\n\nWebb, a Deschutes national forest spokesperson, told the Oregonian/OregonLive that the government's goal is \"voluntary compliance\", but Forest Service officers and staff will patrol and \"enforce the closure and ensure public safety\".",

            "body": "Where Labor, Coalition and Greens stand on key issuesGeorgie Kibel, Blair Jackson, Jessica WangNewsWireFri, 2 May 2025 7:02AM\n\nAustralians across the nation are set to head to the polling booths to decide who will lead the nation for the next three years.\n\nThroughout a rapid election campaign period, the parties have revealed (and sometimes rolled back) their policies on key issues such as health, the cost of living, housing, energy, defence, migration, crime and Indigenous affairs.\n\nTo help you decide who gets your vote, we've compiled a quick guide outlining the major policies on key issues from Labor, the Coalition and the Greens.\n\nHealth\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Albanese government's flagship campaign promise was $8.5bn to deliver an additional 18 million bulk-billed GP visits each year if re-elected. The Labor government also pledged a cap of $25 per prescription for medicines covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Both of these policies were matched by the Coalition. The Coalition will also match Labor's $575m plan to add oral contraceptives, menopause hormone therapies, endometriosis and IVF drugs to the PBS.\n\nFeel like giving the politicians a rating this Federal election?\n\nOur Pollie Rater lets you do just that.\n\nRate the politicians\n\nLabor: In addition to the above policies, Labor pledged a $1bn boost for headspace clinics and specialist centres for youth, $644m for 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, and $16.7m to bolster mental health support services for new parents.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has promised a $5m review of women-specific items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS, $500m to raise Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20, $400m for youth mental health and a $15m boost to the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund.\n\nGreens: The Greens also support an expansion of Medicare but at a far greater level. They have pledged $195bn to Medicare to expand the system to include dental and extended mental health support.\n\nCost of living\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Coalition has backed Labor's position to freeze the alcohol excise on draught beer for two years, starting from August 1, 2025. Both parties have also agreed to extend energy bill rebates for all households until the end of 2025, saving $150 per household at a cost of $1.8bn.\n\nLabor: Effective from June 1, 2025, the Labor government will implement a 20 per cent reduction on all student loan debts, including HELP, VET Student Loans and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans. A re-elected Labor government would introduce an instant $1000 tax deduction for work-related expenses, and tax breaks announced during the federal budget for those in the lowest bracket would be made permanent.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged a one-time tax offset of up to $1200 for workers earning up to $144,000. If elected, the Coalition would cut the fuel excise in half for 12 months starting in July, but it would repeal the changes that give people in the lowest bracket a tax break.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to make all public transport cost 50c, wipe all student debt and provide universal mental health care with unlimited sessions.\n\nHousing\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both have promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from buying existing homes for two years and have ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\nLabor: Labor will expand its Homes for Australia plan to build an extra 100,000 homes specifically for first-time buyers, and all first-home buyers will be eligible for 5 per cent deposits.\n\nCoalition: TheCoalition will allow first-home buyers to take 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to $50,000, for a home deposit. First-home buyers of new properties will be able to claim the interest paid on the first $650,000 of a mortgage as a tax deduction. The Coalition has also vowed to maintain the Home Guarantee Scheme program, which includes a 5 per cent deposit program for first-homebuyers, and a 2 per cent deposit scheme for single parents or eligible single legal guardians with at least one dependent.\n\nGreens: The Greens will phase out tax handouts for property investors with more than one investment property by scrapping the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. They also pledge to limit rent increases to 2 per cent every two years.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both Labor and the Coalition have committed to a $10m investment in a new Bureau of Meteorology weather radar for regional Queensland.\n\nLabor: Labor will slash the cost of solar battery installations by up to $4000 per household from July 1 and extend the energy bill rebate until the end of the year, saving households $150. Labor will also aim to source 82 per cent of the electricity grid from renewables by 2030.\n\nCoalition: One of the Liberal Party's flagship policies is its nuclear plan. A Coalition government will build seven government-owned nuclear reactors co-located alongside retiring coal-fired generators by 2050, with the first two smaller generators in operation by 2035. Under a Coalition government, the energy mix will be 54 per cent renewables, 33 per cent nuclear, with the remaining 13 per cent battery storage and gas.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to block all new coal and gas projects. The Greens' climate and energy plan includes expanding the Net Zero Economy Authority to support all fossil fuel workers and invest $10bn in clean industries and infrastructure in transitioning regions.\n\nDefence\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have pledged to regain ownership of the Port of Darwin.\n\nLabor: Labor has pledged at least $50.3bn into defence over the next decade, with Anthony Albanese leaving the door open to further increases. An additional $262m has been allocated to bolster local defence industries and develop Australia's nuclear-powered submarine supply chain under the AUKUS partnership.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition's flagship defence policy is a $21bn boost to the defence budget over the next five years, pushing total military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The Coalition has pledged to speed up the AUKUS submarine agreement, though it has not detailed how.\n\nThe Greens: The Greens have pledged to withdraw from the AUKUS political pact and renegotiate Australia's position in the ANZUS treaty. As a result, the Greens would attempt to stop the $375bn purchase of AUKUS nuclear submarines.\n\nMigration\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have announced they will increase the cost of student visa applications. The Coalition pledged to triple the cost of student visa applications to $5000 (up from $1600), while a re-elected Labor government would increase the cost of student visa applications to $2000.\n\nLabor: Labor has been relatively silent on the issue of migration but canned the Coalition's policies as \"savage\".\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged to reduce the permanent migration intake by 25 per cent. The cuts would target those on skilled visas in an effort to lower permanent migration from 185,000 in 2024-25 to 140,000 in 2025-26. Mr Dutton has also said the party would slash the number of international students by 80,000. The Coalition has also made a commitment to reduce the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.\n\nGreens: The Greens want to expand Australia's humanitarian intake to 50,000 places per year and create additional places via a new private humanitarian sponsorship program.\n\nCrime\n\nLabor: Labor has promised $157m over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco and $8.6m in funding for management of domestic violence perpetrators. It has pledged to take steps to prevent domestic violence perpetrators from using the tax and corporate systems to create debts as a form of coercive control.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition announced a $750m package to tackle crime across the nation. Dubbed \"Operation Safer Communities\", the Opposition Leader's plan would implement a national drug strike team and a 12-month pilot of a National Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme. The Coalition has also pledged $90m to tackle domestic violence, including implementing a National Domestic Violence Register to ensure police and relevant agencies can share information about violent offenders.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to fund the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children with $12n over 12 years. They have also earmarked $3.3m for a national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to help people who may be at risk of domestic violence to find out if their current or former partner has a history of violent criminal offences.\n\nIndigenous affairs\n\nLabor: Labor has broadly committed to a continuation of efforts to close the gap. It has promised an extra $5mn towards pre-existing plans for a TAFE Centre of Excellence with hubs in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and $77m towards sea wall and wastewater infrastructure in the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has vowed to establish a royal commission into allegations of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities and reintroduce compulsory income management via the Cashless Debit Card.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged $250 to establish a National Truth and Justice Commission to acknowledge and document historic and ongoing injustices. They will also introduce a federal Act to protect First Nations cultural heritage.\n\nOriginally published as Where Labor, Coalition and Greens stand on key issues\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",
