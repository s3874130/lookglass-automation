            "title": "China Detains Investors Who Complained About State-Linked Financial Scam",
            "body": "Chinese police have reportedly detained dozens of small investors who were scammed out of their money by a state-linked investment group, accusing the victims of acting on behalf of \"overseas anti-China forces\" by airing their grievances in public.\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is the Shandong Jianghaihui Financial Group, a government-supported investment company headquartered in Shandong province. The company abruptly ceased operations in March, and its founder fled to the United States along with his wife.\n\nRoughly 100,000 small investors were angered to discover their $2.74 billion in investments went up in smoke when the financial group dissolved. When the Chinese government seemed disinclined to do anything about it, the defrauded investors began talking to reporters -- and the government very quickly did something about them.\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Wednesday that dozens of victimized depositors, most of them women, have been detained by the police after they tried to get around the Communist regime's embargo on news coverage of the Shandong Jianghaihui story by talking to foreign reporters, including RFA itself.\n\n\"All the people who had contacted you from here were detained,\" a source in Shandong told RFA. \"They said we were being used by international anti-China forces and that we were all committing crimes.\"\n\nAccording to RFA's sources, Chinese police looked for news reports about the Shandong financial collapse on foreign websites, got the names of the sources for their stories, and started rounding them up. Some of the unfortunate depositors were released within a matter of days, while others are in detention to this day.\n\nThere are several reasons the Chinese Communist Party regards this story as so troublesome. The regime is deeply worried about deteriorating public morale as U.S. tariffs bite into China's export economy, so this is an exceptionally bad time for dozens of middle-class women to be talking about how an unscrupulous financial company stole their life savings.\n\nEven worse, the anguished depositors say the government is partly to blame for the Shandong scandal, because oversight of the company was very lax, to say the least. Victims say they invested with the company because they believed its activities were part of the Chinese government's efforts to stimulate private enterprise.\n\nRFA noted a group of defrauded investors wrote the Chinese Communist Party's disciplinary commission and the Ministry of Public Security to ask for help recovering their money. Their letter pointedly asked why the government was describing Shandong Jianghaihui's activities as \"illegal fundraising,\" as if they were some sort of private charitable organization, rather than \"contract fraud.\"\n\nThe reason for this elusive rhetoric is most likely that the financial company held government-issued business licenses and passed government audits for years -- just like a number of other financial companies over the past few years whose owners stuffed company cash in their pockets and fled overseas right before their investment schemes came crashing down.\n\nAnother example was a company called Zhongrong International Trust, which held $108 billion in assets at its peak, but went bankrupt in 2024. Chinese officials began the process of liquidating the trust's assets on April 15, prompting large protests by empty-handed investors that were studiously ignored by Chinese state media -- but not by dissidents such as the famed \"Mr. Li Is Not Your Teacher\" social media account:\n\nMr. Li noted that over a hundred of the demonstrators, including \"the elderly, women, and cancer patients,\" were \"violently dragged\" from the scene of the Zhongrong Trust protest by police.",

            "title": "Exclusive  --  Leading Romanian Politician: Let's 'Make Europe Great Again'",
            "body": "WASHINGTON -- George Simion, the leading candidate in the upcoming Romanian presidential election, told Breitbart News that if he wins and if a similarly conservative anti-globalist candidate wins in Poland in presidential elections in May that President Donald Trump will have two major new allies in the European Union.\n\nRomania had elected hardline conservative anti-globalist Calin Georgescu late last year, but the election was called off and nullified after he was accused of being pro-Russian. Romanians scheduled a new election for May, and Simion -- who has promised Georgescu a position in his government if he wins -- has emerged as the front-running candidate. Protests have erupted across Romania with people objecting to interference in their elections from Brussels, globalist plotters who canceled Georgescu's victory.\n\nSimion was in Washington in mid-April to meet with top conservatives close to President Trump and during his visit sat for an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.\n\nAsked about the anger from the people that the international community has seen since Georgescu's victory was nullified by globalists, Simion told Breitbart News: \"Would't you be?\"\n\n\"You would storm onto the streets and you would be protesting in a manner that you would harangue them -- the guys that did the coup d'etat, the establishment guys, the deep state guys combined with our public government,\" Simeon told Breitbart News. \"They were losing big time -- they were organizing the elections and they lost big time. So they renounced the elections because they didn't like Georgescu's stances. They said he had pro Russia stances. It's arguable, but -- it's arguable that Donald Trump did this. We have a globalist ambassador here and the U.S. has a globalist ambassador to Bucharest, also a Biden woman, they said Simion was in Russia making antisemitic statements. He was phoning people around Washington. I've never been to Moscow. They said okay Georgescu had pro-Russian stances. Last I checked, this is not forbidden by the Constitution and the electoral law. Of course, I would never have pro-Russian stances. Nobody in Romania would win with a pro-Russian stances actually. Russia did the biggest harm to us in the last hundred years in order to have a population that loves Russia or Russians.\"\n\nSimion is not concerned that they might be able to do to him what they did to Georgescu because now the whole world is watching and Brussels-based globalists and other far-left actors in Romania cannot get away with it. But he does expect some leftist shenanigans and is prepared to fight it out to victory.\n\n\"It would be too much now that everybody is looking,\" Simion said. \"We have international observers. Nobody was expecting this inside a country inside the European Union. It is too much to annul the election. They will try some scams. They will try to rig some votes and steal some ballots. This is usual for them because they are liars and they are thieves. They will do anything in their power to keep their power.\"\n\nSimion and several other candidates will face off on Sunday in a first round of the presidential election. The top two vote-getters in the May 4 contest will advance to a May 18 final head-to-head election, and Brussels is quite literally freaking out that Simion might win. Recent polling has had him double digits ahead of everyone else in the race, but he's still only in the mid-30s, so while he is expected to finish atop the field on Sunday, he's got to then within two weeks really close it down and win big getting majority support on May 18 to become Romania's next president.\n\n\"Polls will be however you have some psychological phenomenon, silent spiral, but I'm leading big time yes,\" Simion said when asked about the polls, adding that he's ready for a real fight with the globalist elites in the home stretch.\n\n\"They were expecting, 'okay, we will dismantle him through the MSM. We will kill him,'\" Simion said. \"This is why in this election people are already going to vote. Some people are already casting their ballots in the U.S. and Canada abroad -- the Romanians abroad -- some of them already voted in the voting stations, not by mail. So yes, this is one of the reasons I'm here, to spread the word and sound the alarm that they are not democrats but authoritarian tyrants that want to control Romania and they are allowed and are ordered by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.\"\n\nRomania is one of the European Union's 27 member nations. Located in Eastern Europe, it borders Ukraine, and the threats from Russia are very real to Romanians. Romanians have gone decades without a leader like Simion -- and he has come to lead a movement of disenfranchised Romanians who feel like their votes were stolen last year.\n\n\"First of all, it's not about me. It's the fact I'm continuing this sovereign-ist movement, a representative of this sovereign-ist movement started by Calin Georgescu,\" Simion told Breitbart News. \"I'm his replacement. People are upset and they want their president back. Their president is Georgescu and we will bring him to power through these elections and all the means that is necessary. Second, of course, it will be the first time in Romania in the last 35 years where we have had a patriotic, sovereign-ist president. So this is the reason they are voting for me. I'm 38 years old. I will fight. The ideals of the Romanian Revolution of 1989 will be transformed into reality. People died hoping that we have free elections, democracy, and freedom. We forgot about this. It turns out the fight continues for freedom and all of our lives. You must fight generation to generation, and you must win. So this is what we are doing right now.\"\n\nSimion said the movement politics of working class people rejecting globalists -- what's happened in the U.S. and might be happening in Romania -- is \"of course a reaction, an allergic reaction or an antibody reaction, from the people against all these crazy ideas and ideologies and crazy stuff like lies about how cows are polluting and we must kill the cows, we must kill the grandmothers, and we must kill everybody because we have a death culture and Satanic ideology behind us.\"\n\n\"It's common sense that people are supporting and returning to their roots and returning to normality,\" Simion said.\n\nSimion said he knows that if he wins he will be the most likely of any of the remaining candidates to have warm relations with President Trump and the United States. Simion also mentioned that Poland, which is also having its presidential elections in May, has a similar opportunity to elect a fresh young anti-globalist conservative. The two of them are essentially running as a ticket, freaking Brussels out even more.\n\n\"I am not hoping -- I know,\" he replied when asked if he hopes to have close relations with Trump if he wins. \"I am the only one who has channels to the Trump administration. The Trump administration doesn't want to talk with our public government selected by Brussels. Yes, America would be our main focus and key strategic partner. We are the natural partners and we are ideologically the same with the MAGA movement. You can consider me a MAGA candidate -- the only MAGA candidate in the Romanian election. But what's more interesting and important is I'm also supporting the Polish candidate in their presidential elections on the same day in Poland. Karol Nawrocki, the successor of Andrzej Duda, is the candidate of the party of Mr. [Jarosław] Kaczyński. We would be two presidents that if we win the elections in May would be pro-Trump presidents, pro-freedom presidents, and against the Brussels bureaucracy.\"\n\nWhen Breitbart News told him of the very positive view of President Trump this reporter found in Greece recently, Simion said Trump has far more support across Europe than globalist institutions like the establishment media would have anyone believe. He mentioned how close he and other conservative leaders are with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni -- this interview was conducted right after Meloni's visit to the White House.\n\n\"I'm sure this is the fact,\" Simion said. \"In Romania, President Trump in their fake polls from the 27 states has the biggest approval rating of his actions. I think what we started and continue the MAGA movement with MEGA -- Make Europe Great Again, I'm the co-founder of that in Europe -- we will be victorious. I think it's a matter of time after winning in Romania and Poland before we have a majority of governments across the 27 states of the European Union that are pro-Trump and MAGA-oriented. This is what we have to do -- we are in the European party of Giorgia Meloni. Giorgia is our dear friend and leader. Yesterday she was at the White House.\"\n\nSimion said he agrees with Meloni's and Trump's comments from the Italian leader's White House visit where they pledged to Make the West Great Again. He also said how he and others across Europe believe the globalists at the European Union headquarters in Brussels need to be put in check.\n\n\"Absolutely, when you define the West, you talk about Italy,\" Simion said. \"And she managed to make it, she has it in Italy many times, Italia Protaginsta. She managed in only two years to do it and be a model. So yes, I would think we would have a series of pro-Trump leaders across Europe who are winning and will deal directly with the Trump administration and which will stop Ursula von der Leyen and these nasty people that remind us of crooked Joe Biden.\"\n\nSimion added that given that Romania shares a border with Ukraine, his country has unique credibility among European Union member nations on how to deal with Russia and Ukraine. He said that Russia is a malign actor in the region and cannot be trusted.\n\n\"Russia is a big danger for us, for Poland, for the Baltic states,\" Simion said. \"We must stop Russia. But what's happening right now is not stopping Russia, it's only making Russia become an important actor again. This war doesn't go anywhere. Of course it's condemnable and you cannot ask for a country to give up territory. But we have to deescalate the conflict. I hope and pray President Trump will do so and obtain a ceasefire and peace negotiations. It's the only way possible, with new security guarantees for the next 40 to 50 years so that Russia doesn't do this again because it's like an MO from their part... We need new security guarantees.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Trump's tariffs, Simion said Trump's speeches throughout his career made it \"obvious\" the president was focused on China with them.\n\n\"It's obvious that the tariffs were not targeting the European countries,\" Simion said. \"It was just stupid Emmanuel Macron who tried to put tariffs on the digital products from the United States and I'm sure we will find a solution in the economic relationship with the United States. Of course, the tariffs are about China -- only if you listen to the speeches of the last 10 years of Donald Trump you would understand this. But some pretend they do not understand. So if America wouldn't have done this now, in 10 years Americans wouldn't be the biggest power in the world. It's something you need to do, and it's something we need to do, because we stopped producing in our countries and we have had some not so smart people influencing things like experts and university professors who were saying you could live like this forever not producing anything but having the good life. We should get our jobs back and we should get our production back in Europe and in America and only then we can really stop others from growing.\"\n\nHe said too that he hopes after the elections in Romania and Poland that are upcoming that Trump and the U.S. will have friends in the presidencies of two major European nations in just a few weeks' time.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that after the end of May, America will regain two of its important partners -- both Romania and Poland,\" Simion said. \"We are committed not only to the idea of friendship between Romania and the United States but also to the values I know on which we stand -- freedom of speech, democracy, common sense.\"",

            "body": "Taxpayers may get their gooses cooked paying for a duck massacre.\n\nA Long Island duck farm is asking for the federal government to quack up $1 million after it euthanized 100,000 of its flocks over bird flu fears, documents show.\n\nCrescent Duck Farm, which supplies 4% of the nation's duck meat, has already received $150,000 from the USDA and is asking for more after it put down tens of thousands of birds -- and now animal activists are slamming the cost and the carnage.\n\nThe farm used carbon dioxide foam, then snapped the necks of surviving birds with a handheld scissor-like tool called the Koechner Euthanizing Device, according to USDA documents.\n\n\"If you see videos of it, it looks like a scene from a horror movie,\" Ben Williamson, the executive director of Animal Outlook, told The Post of the foam. \"It doesn't knock them out, it doesn't stun them. They essentially will suffocate, and will be conscious while they're suffocating ... and then the ones who survive have their necks rung by these devices.\"\n\nBut Crescent Duck Farm owner Doug Corwin told The Post the UDSA ended up using a different killing method, and the farm \"had nothing to do with whatever was decided upon.\"\n\n\"This was a heartbreaking thing,\" he added. \"We had no standing in that.\"\n\nA request for comment from the USDA was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 116-year-old farm on the North Fork estimated it was owed $811,635 from the government due to the mass culling after 700 Peking ducks died from the virus in January, records show.\n\nThe requested funds were used for sanitization, disposal and replacement of roughly $166,365 in losses, the farm said. Corwin told The Post the USDA has reimbursed to date \"about 10%\" of what the flock was worth,\" or about $150,000, and is expecting more.\n\nLong Island animal activists weren't taken by the sob story -- or use of government cash.\n\n\"New Yorkers don't go to work with the intention of spending our hard-earned money on a multimillion-dollar enterprise that kills a million 6-week-old ducklings a year while they're still peeping,\" said John Di Leonardo, executive director of animal rights group Humane Long Island.\n\nPoultry farms and live markets are mandated to kill inventory when highly-contagious bird flu is detected, and dozens of outbreaks have torn through New York State in 2025, according to the USDA website.\n\nThe first case of bird flu in the U.S. was detected in 2022 and has since resulted in the deaths of an estimated 166 million birds. Toxic carbon dioxide foam is used in culling about half of the time, per a USDA report, and require secondary measures to kill surviving ducks about 29% of the time.\n\nDespite the culling at Crescent, The Post reported in February that more than 3,700 new ducklings hatched at an off-site location.\n\nThe ducks can return to the North Fork once barns are found to be free of any active avian flu DNA, Corwin said, adding the barns were last tested Monday.\n\n\"The ducks are nine weeks old and in good shape,\" Corwin said. \"We're hoping to bring them home when we can - when its 100% safe to do so.\"\n\nWilliamson told The Post he will be presenting an offer to the farm on Thursday to help the business transition to crop production instead, which he deems more \"humane and sustainable\" than duck farming.\n\n\"While we recognize Crescent Duck Farm's historical significance to Long Island, the documents we've obtained reveal not just the financial cost to taxpayers, but also the grim reality of how these birds met their end,\" he said.\n\nCorwin, however, balked at the idea of scrapping his beloved ducks for farming lettuce and other vegetation.\n\n\"It's going to take me a year and a half to get any income off of this place [after the culling],\" he said. \"I'd be better off to bulldoze every barn we have and put it up for sale, but I'm a farmer at heart.\"",

            "title": "Maduro Regime Denies Colombia's Claim that Marxist Terrorist Group Is Operating in Venezuela",
            "body": "The socialist regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro rejected claims made by far-left Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday that Colombian drug trafficker Jobanis de Jesús Ávila Villadiego has formed an alliance with the National Liberation Army (ELN) Marxist terror group in Venezuelan territory.\n\nVilladiego, also known as Chiquito malo (\"Bad Little Boy\"), is the current leader of the Colombian Clan del Golfo drug cartel, succeeding its previous leader Dairo \"Otoniel\" Úsuga David after he was arrested in 2021 and sentenced to 45 years on numerous drug trafficking charges in 2023.\n\nPetro, through a Wednesday Twitter post, asserted that Villadiego had formed an alliance with ELN inside the territory of neighboring Venezuela. Petro added that Colombian authorities have already seized 32 tons of cocaine from the Catatumbo region and arrested \"several mayors and politicians who were helping the drug traffickers.\"\n\n\"Crop substitution in Catatumbo is essential to achieving peace. Violence in the Caribbean revolves around ports and extortion. I've decided to change the entire port administration,\" Petro's message said.\n\n\"There will be a special meeting today to intensify the offensive against Clan del Golfo,\" he continued. \"I expect from the Caribbean citizens, and with due confidentiality, information to find the leaders of the Clan.\"\n\nPetro's statements drew fierce criticism from the socialist Maduro regime.\n\nThe Colombian newspaper El Tiempo reported on Wednesday that it had obtained a copy of an official letter sent by the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry to its Colombian counterpart protesting Petro's social media post and rejecting being held responsible for \"dynamics that have their origin and expansion in Colombian territory.\"\n\n\"Such statements, deeply inconsiderate, constitute a petty expression that ignores the firm commitment of the Venezuelan State to the fight against drug trafficking and transnational organized crime, as well as the important operational efforts that the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) have been carrying out for weeks to safeguard national sovereignty,\" the note said.\n\nColombia's Catatumbo region is presently the epicenter of a gruesome conflict between the Marxist ELN and the equally Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) terrorist group over control of the region's coca leaf crops, the main ingredient used in the manufacture of cocaine.\n\nThe conflict dramatically escalated in mid-January after ELN broke a tacit \"non-aggression\" pact that both terror groups had agreed upon in 2022 and which established limits on their respective areas of influence and illicit economic activities. The ongoing conflict left nearly 100 dead and over 60,000 local residents displaced as of March.\n\nSeveral reports published in recent years have denounced that ELN began a process of expansion in Venezuelan territory that has effectively turned it into a \"bi-national\" guerilla force.\n\nAlthough ELN has historically used Venezuela as a \"refuge\" from Colombian law enforcement operations since the 1980s, the Marxist terrorist group established a firm foothold in Venezuelan territory thanks to its friendly ties with the Venezuelan socialist regime, first established under the auspices of late dictator Hugo Chávez.\n\nUnnamed human rights activists cited by the Venezuelan outlet Armando Info in April explained that ELN has a permanent presence \"along the entire border\" between both countries, especially in the neighboring states of Zulia and Táchira, and has used Venezuelan territory to stage operations in Colombia since at least 2020.\n\nVenezuelan Interior Minister -- and actively wanted drug lord -- Diosdado Cabello refuted Petro's accusations during the latest broadcast of his weekly socialist show Hitting with the Mallet, urging Petro to \"not bring Venezuela into your problems.\"\n\n\"I always ask myself why he [Petro] has to drag Venezuela into his schemes. In Venezuela we are fighting a frontal battle against all the drug trafficking, paramilitary, and terrorist mafias. What was achieved in Venezuela was thanks to Venezuelan Intelligence and Counterintelligence,\" Cabello claimed.\n\n\"Why does the President of Colombia have to meddle with Venezuela? The problem is where the drugs are produced. Venezuela has deployed more than 5,000 troops of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces and police throughout its territory,\" he added.\n\nCabello urged Colombia to stop blaming the Venezuelan regime and describing the neighboring country as \"neighbors who throw stones at neighbors and you have to respond.\"",

Only the top-spec Hybrid+ Essence exceeds the $30,000 mark.\n\nThe MG 3 retains a comprehensive suite of standard safety gear, which includes lane-keep assist, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert - though the latter two have been removed from the Vibe.\n\nHundreds of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. Browse now.\n\nThe MG 3 is by far the best-selling vehicle in its segment, holding a 48.4 per cent share in 2024 despite the price increase from the old generation to the new.\n\nWith 3081 sales to the end of March 2025, the MG 3 is up 6.6 per cent on the 2889 figure during the same period last year, and the addition of a cheaper version should contribute to a further increase in sales.\n\nIts closest rivals are now just the Picanto and Suzuki Swift Hybrid, as the cheapest range-opening variants of the Mazda 2 sedan and hatch were axed earlier this year, increasing the model's starting price by more than $4000.\n\nThe MG 3 Vibe is now considerably cheaper than the base Swift Hybrid manual ($24,490 before on-roads) and, as mentioned, slightly more expensive than the Picanto Sport manual.\n\nAt the top of the range, the MG 3 Hybrid+ Excite remains the cheapest electrified vehicle in Australia at $27,990 before on-roads, undercutting the Toyota Yaris Ascent Sport Hybrid at $28,500 before on-roads.\n\nPricing\n\nPrices are unchanged from 2024, except that the addition of the range-opening Vibe variant brings the new MG 3 range below $22,000 for the first time. Drive-away offers are currently in place across the range, so we've listed prices before on-roads below for clarity.\n\nDrivetrains and EfficiencyDimensionsServicing and Warranty\n\nMG Motor Australia offers a market-leading 10-year, 250,000km warranty for its model range, and MG 3 service intervals are 12 months or 10,000km, whichever comes first.\n\nMG's service pricing guide differs between petrol and Hybrid+ MG 3 models, with individual prices detailed below:\n\nSafety\n\nThe MG 3 wears a three-star ANCAP safety rating, based on testing conducted in 2024.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes:\n\n6 airbagsAutonomous emergency braking (AEB)Lane departure warningLane-keep assistEmergency lane-keep assistAdaptive cruise controlIntelligent cruise assistIntelligent speed assistReversing cameraRear parking sensorsTyre pressure monitoring\n\nMG 3 Excite adds:\n\nBlind spot monitoringRear cross-traffic assist\n\nThe MG 3 Essence and Hybrid+ Essence are the only two grades to receive a surround-view camera.\n\nStandard Equipment\n\nThere are now three distinct MG 3 trim levels, but only the top two are available with the Hybrid+ powertrain.\n\n2025 MG 3 Vibe equipment highlights:\n\n15-inch steel wheelsTyre repair kitHalogen headlightsLED daytime running lightsAutomatic headlightsRear fog lightElectronic parking brakeAuto-holdTraditional gear selector10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment systemWired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto7.0-inch instrument cluster screen6-speaker sound system6-way manual driver's seat adjustment4-way manual passenger seat adjustmentPolyurethane steering wheelCloth upholsterySingle-zone climate control\n\nMG 3 Excite adds:\n\n16-inch alloy wheelsSpace-saver spare wheelPower-folding, heated side mirrorsPush-button startRear air vent\n\nMG 3 Hybrid+ Excite adds:\n\nTyre repair kit (in lieu of spare tyre)Dial-type gear selector3 drive modesPedestrian warning sound - external speakerAuto climate control\n\nMG 3 Essence adds (over Excite):\n\nProjector LED headlightsRain-sensing wipersSunroofLeatherette and cloth trimLeather-wrapped steering wheelSunglass compartmentRear map pocketsSatellite navigationDAB+ digital radioConnected mobile services (iSmart compatibility)Keyless entryOptions\n\nOnly the range-topping MG 3 Hybrid+ Essence is available with a white interior, a $500 option over the standard black interior.\n\nColours\n\nSeven exterior paint colours are available for the MG 3, and four command a $500 premium.\n\nNo-cost colours:\n\nDover WhitePastel YellowBrighton Blue Metallic\n\nPremium colours ($500 each):\n\nSloane Silver MetallicHampstead Grey MetallicBlack Pearl MetallicDiamond Red Metallic\n\nMORE: Everything MG 3\n\nOriginally published as 2025 MG 3 price and specs: More affordable entry variant joins hatch range\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",
