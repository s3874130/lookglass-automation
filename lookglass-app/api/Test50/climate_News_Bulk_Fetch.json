                "body": "The impact of young voters on the election will become clear after polling day on May 3.\n\nThey're disillusioned, resentful and many suspect the system is rigged against them.\n\nFor the first time, Gen Z and millennial voters outnumber baby boomers at the federal election -- and most of them aren't reaching the same milestones as their parents.\n\nMore than 7 million Australians have already cast their vote ahead of Saturday, and despite a campaign largely shaped by the rising cost of living and housing, it's unclear whether young voters feel satisfied by what's on offer.\n\nPolitical analysts say their grievances could deliver unexpected results in marginal seats.\n\nA widening wealth gap\n\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor in politics at Monash University, said generational inequality could be driving \"unpredictable\" voting patterns among Gen Zs and millennials.\n\n\"They're not reaching the sort of milestones that previous generations did, such as home ownership, marrying [and] having children,\" Dr Strangio said.\n\n\"Those things used to predispose people to becoming more conservative in their outlook.\"\n\nAustralia's birth rate recently hit an all-time low, and government data shows today's 30-34 year-olds are the first age group in more than 47 years where most people don't own a house.\n\nUNSW economics professor Richard Holden said while many young voters earn higher incomes today than their parents did at their age, it was now much harder to build wealth through property ownership.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's rising intergenerational income inequality, but there's a good case to worry about wealth inequality,\" he said.\n\n\"And I'd say that aspect is getting worse.\"\n\nTim Harcourt, an economist at the University of Technology Sydney, agreed the wealth disparity between generations was becoming increasingly acute.\n\n\"It's really starting to bite now as the Baby Boomers retire into their defined benefits superannuation schemes and extra properties,\" he said.\n\n\"I think housing is a red button issue ... and that's where the youth reaction will be really important.\"\n\nYoung voters 'a ticking time bomb'\n\nDr Strangio said voters typically became more conservative as they grew older, but now they're skewing further to the left and feeling increasingly dissatisfied with the major parties.\n\n\"Young voters are a ticking time bomb,\" he said.\n\n\"They're facing real wage declines, high costs for education, difficulty in getting into the housing market and yet so far I think they've been quiet tolerant.\"\n\nBut he warned their patience wouldn't last forever.\n\n\"When we look overseas to places like Trump's America, young men are being attracted to aggressive, populist policies because of inequalities,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's a warning that we do need to address those things with some urgency because we don't want to see those sorts of trends.\"\n\nProfessor Harcourt said while the youth vote typically skewed to the left in inner-city electorates, voting patterns would be harder to predict among tradies or factory workers in rural areas.\n\n\"It's quite unpredictable in the outer suburbs where there's housing stress and population stress, where there is a view that the infrastructure is not keeping up with the population growth,\" he said.\n\nClimate change remains a concern\n\nAside from housing affordability and the cost of living, a new YouGov poll suggests young voters remain deeply concerned about the impacts of climate change.\n\nEarlier this year, Australians' social media accounts lit up with videos of wildfires ripping through Los Angeles and damage from Tropical Cyclone Alfred in parts of Queensland and New South Wales.\n\nAccording to the YouGov poll, four-in-five young voters said climate change would influence their vote in the federal election.\n\nThe poll of 1,622 adult Australian voters, commissioned by Solutions for Climate Australia, found 79 per cent of Gen Zs and 73 per cent of millennials said climate change was an important part of their decision-making at the polling booth.\n\nAbout 67 per cent of undecided voters also said climate change was important in determining their vote.\n\nAustralian Youth Climate Coalition national director Grace Vegesana said the issue wasn't going away.\n\n\"Young people under 40 do deeply care about the climate crisis and if they're not seeing solutions ... they will vote accordingly.\"\n\nShe said many young voters reported feeling left behind this election.\n\n\"We are going to see a shift away from the major parties as people realise [we] want to see ambition, and not just be handed baseline policies that continue business as usual,\" she said.",

                "title": "Your guide to major parties' key policies",
                "body": "Australians across the nation are set to head to the polling booths to decide who will lead the nation for the next three years.\n\nThroughout a rapid election campaign period, the parties have revealed (and sometimes rolled back) their policies on key issues such as health, the cost of living, housing, energy, defence, migration, crime and Indigenous affairs.\n\nTo help you decide who gets your vote, we've compiled a quick guide outlining the major policies on key issues from Labor, the Coalition and the Greens.\n\nHealth\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Albanese government's flagship campaign promise was $8.5bn to deliver an additional 18 million bulk-billed GP visits each year if re-elected. The Labor government also pledged a cap of $25 per prescription for medicines covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Both of these policies were matched by the Coalition. The Coalition will also match Labor's $575m plan to add oral contraceptives, menopause hormone therapies, endometriosis and IVF drugs to the PBS.\n\nLabor: In addition to the above policies, Labor pledged a $1bn boost for headspace clinics and specialist centres for youth, $644m for 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, and $16.7m to bolster mental health support services for new parents.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has promised a $5m review of women-specific items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS, $500m to raise Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20, $400m for youth mental health and a $15m boost to the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund.\n\nGreens: The Greens also support an expansion of Medicare but at a far greater level. They have pledged $195bn to Medicare to expand the system to include dental and extended mental health support.\n\nCost of living\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Coalition has backed Labor's position to freeze the alcohol excise on draught beer for two years, starting from August 1, 2025. Both parties have also agreed to extend energy bill rebates for all households until the end of 2025, saving $150 per household at a cost of $1.8bn.\n\nLabor: Effective from June 1, 2025, the Labor government will implement a 20 per cent reduction on all student loan debts, including HELP, VET Student Loans and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans. A re-elected Labor government would introduce an instant $1000 tax deduction for work-related expenses, and tax breaks announced during the federal budget for those in the lowest bracket would be made permanent.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged a one-time tax offset of up to $1200 for workers earning up to $144,000. If elected, the Coalition would cut the fuel excise in half for 12 months starting in July, but it would repeal the changes that give people in the lowest bracket a tax break.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to make all public transport cost 50c, wipe all student debt and provide universal mental health care with unlimited sessions.\n\nHousing\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both have promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from buying existing homes for two years and have ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\nLabor: Labor will expand its Homes for Australia plan to build an extra 100,000 homes specifically for first-time buyers, and all first-home buyers will be eligible for 5 per cent deposits.\n\nCoalition: TheCoalition will allow first-home buyers to take 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to $50,000, for a home deposit. First-home buyers of new properties will be able to claim the interest paid on the first $650,000 of a mortgage as a tax deduction. The Coalition has also vowed to maintain the Home Guarantee Scheme program, which includes a 5 per cent deposit program for first-homebuyers, and a 2 per cent deposit scheme for single parents or eligible single legal guardians with at least one dependent.\n\nGreens: The Greens will phase out tax handouts for property investors with more than one investment property by scrapping the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. They also pledge to limit rent increases to 2 per cent every two years.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both Labor and the Coalition have committed to a $10m investment in a new Bureau of Meteorology weather radar for regional Queensland.\n\nLabor: Labor will slash the cost of solar battery installations by up to $4000 per household from July 1 and extend the energy bill rebate until the end of the year, saving households $150. Labor will also aim to source 82 per cent of the electricity grid from renewables by 2030.\n\nCoalition: One of the Liberal Party's flagship policies is its nuclear plan. A Coalition government will build seven government-owned nuclear reactors co-located alongside retiring coal-fired generators by 2050, with the first two smaller generators in operation by 2035. Under a Coalition government, the energy mix will be 54 per cent renewables, 33 per cent nuclear, with the remaining 13 per cent battery storage and gas.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to block all new coal and gas projects. The Greens' climate and energy plan includes expanding the Net Zero Economy Authority to support all fossil fuel workers and invest $10bn in clean industries and infrastructure in transitioning regions.\n\nDefence\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have pledged to regain ownership of the Port of Darwin.\n\nLabor: Labor has pledged at least $50.3bn into defence over the next decade, with Anthony Albanese leaving the door open to further increases. An additional $262m has been allocated to bolster local defence industries and develop Australia's nuclear-powered submarine supply chain under the AUKUS partnership.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition's flagship defence policy is a $21bn boost to the defence budget over the next five years, pushing total military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The Coalition has pledged to speed up the AUKUS submarine agreement, though it has not detailed how.\n\nThe Greens: The Greens have pledged to withdraw from the AUKUS political pact and renegotiate Australia's position in the ANZUS treaty. As a result, the Greens would attempt to stop the $375bn purchase of AUKUS nuclear submarines.\n\nMigration\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have announced they will increase the cost of student visa applications. The Coalition pledged to triple the cost of student visa applications to $5000 (up from $1600), while a re-elected Labor government would increase the cost of student visa applications to $2000.\n\nLabor: Labor has been relatively silent on the issue of migration but canned the Coalition's policies as \"savage\".\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged to reduce the permanent migration intake by 25 per cent. The cuts would target those on skilled visas in an effort to lower permanent migration from 185,000 in 2024-25 to 140,000 in 2025-26. Mr Dutton has also said the party would slash the number of international students by 80,000. The Coalition has also made a commitment to reduce the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.\n\nGreens: The Greens want to expand Australia's humanitarian intake to 50,000 places per year and create additional places via a new private humanitarian sponsorship program.\n\nCrime\n\nLabor: Labor has promised $157m over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco and $8.6m ï\"¿in funding for management of domestic violence perpetrators. It has pledged to take steps to prevent domestic violence perpetrators from using the tax and corporate systems to create debts as a form of coercive control.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition announced a $750m package to tackle crime across the nation. Dubbed \"Operation Safer Communities\", the Opposition Leader's plan would implement a national drug strike team and a 12-month pilot of a National Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme. The Coalition has also pledged $90m to tackle domestic violence, including implementing a National Domestic Violence Register to ensure police and relevant agencies can share information about violent offenders.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to fund the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children with $12n over 12 years. They have also earmarked $3.3m for a national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to help people who may be at risk of domestic violence to find out if their current or former partner has a history of violent criminal offences.\n\nIndigenous affairs\n\nLabor: Labor has broadly committed to a continuation of efforts to close the gap. It has promised an extra $5mn towards pre-existing plans for a TAFE Centre of Excellence with hubs in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and $77m towards sea wall and wastewater infrastructure in the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has vowed to establish a royal commission into allegations of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities and reintroduce compulsory income management via the Cashless Debit Card.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged $250 to establish a National Truth and Justice Commission to acknowledge and document historic and ongoing injustices. They will also introduce a federal Act to protect First Nations cultural heritage.",

                "body": "Service closing area in Oregon for wildfire prevention plan months after Trump order to increase timber production\n\nDozens of homeless people who have been living in a national forest in central Oregon for years were being evicted on Thursday by the US Forest Service, as it closed the area for a wildfire prevention project that will involve removing smaller trees, clearing debris and setting controlled burns over thousands of acres.\n\nThe project has been on the books for years, and the decision to remove the encampment in the Deschutes national forest comes two months after the Trump administration issued an executive order directing federal agencies to increase timber production and forest management projects aimed at reducing wildfire risk. It wasn't immediately clear if the evictions were a result of that order, but homeless advocates seized on the timing on Thursday, as US Forest Service officers blocked the access road.\n\n\"The fact that they are doing this with such vigor shortly after they announced that the forests would be opened up for logging I don't think is a coincidence,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture, which oversees the US Forest Service, and the service's Pacific Northwest Region did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\n\"The closure does not target any specific user group and will restrict all access, including day use and overnight camping, while crews operate heavy machinery, conduct prescribed burns, and clean up hazardous materials,\" Deschutes national forest spokesperson Kaitlyn Webb said in an email. \"It's not safe for the public to be in the area while heavy machinery is operating, trees are being felled, mowing operations are active, and prescribed burning is occurring.\"\n\nCampers who had set up trailers, recreational vehicles and tents amidst the ponderosa pines in the Deschutes national forest scrambled in the darkness Wednesday night to pack up and get their engines working again. Authorities closed the two-lane road in the early hours of Thursday morning, and it was not immediately clear how many people were left in the forest by the afternoon, though some were unable to leave.\n\nThe US Forest Service has been working for years on plans to close part of the Deschutes national forest near Bend for forest restoration and wildfire mitigation. But the number of people living in that part of the forest has grown, with many losing homes during the coronavirus pandemic due to job losses and high housing costs, Rabinowitz said.\n\nDonald Trump's administration has acted to roll back environmental safeguards around future logging projects on more than half of US national forests, under an emergency designation that cites dangers from wildfires.\n\nWhether the administration's move will boost lumber supplies as Trump envisioned in an executive order he signed in March remains to be seen. Joe Biden's administration also sought more logging in public forests to combat fires, which have become more intense amid drier and hotter conditions linked to the climate crisis, yet US Forest Service timber sales stayed relatively flat under his tenure.\n\nThe Cabin Butte Vegetation Management Project, a wildfire mitigation treatment on some 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares), is prompting the closures in the Deschutes national forest.\n\nThe goal of the work is to reduce wildfire risk and restore damaged habitats where development encroaches on natural areas near Bend, Deschutes national forest officials said in a statement. Recreation sites and trails in that area will be closed through April next year.\n\nMultiple US Forest Service officials and vehicles were stationed at the Deschutes national forest road closure on Thursday. A sign on the metal gate blocking the road said the temporary emergency closure will last at least one year.\n\nViolators could face up six months in jail, fines up to $5,000, or both.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mandy Bryant, who said she had lived in the encampment for about three years, was cleaning up her site and trying to get a trailer to start so she could move it.\n\n\"You could feel the heaviness in the air and just the stress and depression that people are feeling,\" she told the Associated Press. \"We're up there on the list of groups of people that society doesn't really care for.\"\n\nFour people living in the encampment including Bryant, along with two homeless advocates, filed for a restraining order to stop the closure earlier this month. The claim argued it would cause irreparable harm to more than 100 people who were living there, many of whom have disabilities.\n\nThe government responded in court filings that US Forest Service staff in January began notifying homeless people living in the area of the upcoming closure. Original plans for the project were published in 2019 and were authorized by the US Forest Service in 2023, the court filings said.\n\nUS district court judge Michael McShane denied the restraining order on Tuesday and issued a written opinion on Thursday.\n\n\"The public's significant interest in restoring natural habitats, preventing catastrophic wildfires, and preserving the overall health of Deschutes National Forest is not outweighed by the interest of 150 or so individuals in residing on this particular plot of land,\" he wrote in his ruling.\n\nWebb, a Deschutes national forest spokesperson, told the Oregonian/OregonLive that the government's goal is \"voluntary compliance\", but Forest Service officers and staff will patrol and \"enforce the closure and ensure public safety\".",

                "body": "Where Labor, Coalition and Greens stand on key issuesGeorgie Kibel, Blair Jackson, Jessica WangNewsWireFri, 2 May 2025 7:02AM\n\nAustralians across the nation are set to head to the polling booths to decide who will lead the nation for the next three years.\n\nThroughout a rapid election campaign period, the parties have revealed (and sometimes rolled back) their policies on key issues such as health, the cost of living, housing, energy, defence, migration, crime and Indigenous affairs.\n\nTo help you decide who gets your vote, we've compiled a quick guide outlining the major policies on key issues from Labor, the Coalition and the Greens.\n\nHealth\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Albanese government's flagship campaign promise was $8.5bn to deliver an additional 18 million bulk-billed GP visits each year if re-elected. The Labor government also pledged a cap of $25 per prescription for medicines covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Both of these policies were matched by the Coalition. The Coalition will also match Labor's $575m plan to add oral contraceptives, menopause hormone therapies, endometriosis and IVF drugs to the PBS.\n\nFeel like giving the politicians a rating this Federal election?\n\nOur Pollie Rater lets you do just that.\n\nRate the politicians\n\nLabor: In addition to the above policies, Labor pledged a $1bn boost for headspace clinics and specialist centres for youth, $644m for 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, and $16.7m to bolster mental health support services for new parents.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has promised a $5m review of women-specific items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS, $500m to raise Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20, $400m for youth mental health and a $15m boost to the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund.\n\nGreens: The Greens also support an expansion of Medicare but at a far greater level. They have pledged $195bn to Medicare to expand the system to include dental and extended mental health support.\n\nCost of living\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Coalition has backed Labor's position to freeze the alcohol excise on draught beer for two years, starting from August 1, 2025. Both parties have also agreed to extend energy bill rebates for all households until the end of 2025, saving $150 per household at a cost of $1.8bn.\n\nLabor: Effective from June 1, 2025, the Labor government will implement a 20 per cent reduction on all student loan debts, including HELP, VET Student Loans and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans. A re-elected Labor government would introduce an instant $1000 tax deduction for work-related expenses, and tax breaks announced during the federal budget for those in the lowest bracket would be made permanent.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged a one-time tax offset of up to $1200 for workers earning up to $144,000. If elected, the Coalition would cut the fuel excise in half for 12 months starting in July, but it would repeal the changes that give people in the lowest bracket a tax break.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to make all public transport cost 50c, wipe all student debt and provide universal mental health care with unlimited sessions.\n\nHousing\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both have promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from buying existing homes for two years and have ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\nLabor: Labor will expand its Homes for Australia plan to build an extra 100,000 homes specifically for first-time buyers, and all first-home buyers will be eligible for 5 per cent deposits.\n\nCoalition: TheCoalition will allow first-home buyers to take 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to $50,000, for a home deposit. First-home buyers of new properties will be able to claim the interest paid on the first $650,000 of a mortgage as a tax deduction. The Coalition has also vowed to maintain the Home Guarantee Scheme program, which includes a 5 per cent deposit program for first-homebuyers, and a 2 per cent deposit scheme for single parents or eligible single legal guardians with at least one dependent.\n\nGreens: The Greens will phase out tax handouts for property investors with more than one investment property by scrapping the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. They also pledge to limit rent increases to 2 per cent every two years.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both Labor and the Coalition have committed to a $10m investment in a new Bureau of Meteorology weather radar for regional Queensland.\n\nLabor: Labor will slash the cost of solar battery installations by up to $4000 per household from July 1 and extend the energy bill rebate until the end of the year, saving households $150. Labor will also aim to source 82 per cent of the electricity grid from renewables by 2030.\n\nCoalition: One of the Liberal Party's flagship policies is its nuclear plan. A Coalition government will build seven government-owned nuclear reactors co-located alongside retiring coal-fired generators by 2050, with the first two smaller generators in operation by 2035. Under a Coalition government, the energy mix will be 54 per cent renewables, 33 per cent nuclear, with the remaining 13 per cent battery storage and gas.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to block all new coal and gas projects. The Greens' climate and energy plan includes expanding the Net Zero Economy Authority to support all fossil fuel workers and invest $10bn in clean industries and infrastructure in transitioning regions.\n\nDefence\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have pledged to regain ownership of the Port of Darwin.\n\nLabor: Labor has pledged at least $50.3bn into defence over the next decade, with Anthony Albanese leaving the door open to further increases. An additional $262m has been allocated to bolster local defence industries and develop Australia's nuclear-powered submarine supply chain under the AUKUS partnership.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition's flagship defence policy is a $21bn boost to the defence budget over the next five years, pushing total military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The Coalition has pledged to speed up the AUKUS submarine agreement, though it has not detailed how.\n\nThe Greens: The Greens have pledged to withdraw from the AUKUS political pact and renegotiate Australia's position in the ANZUS treaty. As a result, the Greens would attempt to stop the $375bn purchase of AUKUS nuclear submarines.\n\nMigration\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have announced they will increase the cost of student visa applications. The Coalition pledged to triple the cost of student visa applications to $5000 (up from $1600), while a re-elected Labor government would increase the cost of student visa applications to $2000.\n\nLabor: Labor has been relatively silent on the issue of migration but canned the Coalition's policies as \"savage\".\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged to reduce the permanent migration intake by 25 per cent. The cuts would target those on skilled visas in an effort to lower permanent migration from 185,000 in 2024-25 to 140,000 in 2025-26. Mr Dutton has also said the party would slash the number of international students by 80,000. The Coalition has also made a commitment to reduce the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.\n\nGreens: The Greens want to expand Australia's humanitarian intake to 50,000 places per year and create additional places via a new private humanitarian sponsorship program.\n\nCrime\n\nLabor: Labor has promised $157m over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco and $8.6m in funding for management of domestic violence perpetrators. It has pledged to take steps to prevent domestic violence perpetrators from using the tax and corporate systems to create debts as a form of coercive control.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition announced a $750m package to tackle crime across the nation. Dubbed \"Operation Safer Communities\", the Opposition Leader's plan would implement a national drug strike team and a 12-month pilot of a National Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme. The Coalition has also pledged $90m to tackle domestic violence, including implementing a National Domestic Violence Register to ensure police and relevant agencies can share information about violent offenders.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to fund the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children with $12n over 12 years. They have also earmarked $3.3m for a national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to help people who may be at risk of domestic violence to find out if their current or former partner has a history of violent criminal offences.\n\nIndigenous affairs\n\nLabor: Labor has broadly committed to a continuation of efforts to close the gap. It has promised an extra $5mn towards pre-existing plans for a TAFE Centre of Excellence with hubs in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and $77m towards sea wall and wastewater infrastructure in the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has vowed to establish a royal commission into allegations of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities and reintroduce compulsory income management via the Cashless Debit Card.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged $250 to establish a National Truth and Justice Commission to acknowledge and document historic and ongoing injustices. They will also introduce a federal Act to protect First Nations cultural heritage.\n\nOriginally published as Where Labor, Coalition and Greens stand on key issues\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

                "title": "South Korean Presidential Frontrunner Potentially Disqualified by Court Ruling",
                "body": "Lee Jae-myung, the front-running candidate in South Korea's special presidential election, may have been disqualified by a ruling from the Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nLee, the leader of the left-wing Democratic Party of Korea (DP), has been leading in the polls ever since President Yoon Suk-yeol of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) was impeached in December. Yoon was impeached for declaring martial law in December, ostensibly to combat \"subversive anti-state elements.\"\n\nSouth Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed Yoon from office on April 4, paving the way for a special election to replace him on June 3. The interim president who managed the office for most of the time since Yoon's impeachment, Han Duck-soo, resigned his position on Thursday and is expected to enter the race as a candidate.\n\n\"I have two paths ahead of me. One is completing the heavy responsibility that I handle now. The other is putting down that responsibility and taking a heavier responsibility. I've finally determined to put down my post to do what I can and what I have to help overcome the crises facing us,\" Han said on Thursday, strongly suggesting he has an eye on the upcoming election.\n\nHan's resignation would have bumped Minister of Economy and Finance Choi Sang-mok into the acting presidential hot seat -- except the opposition immediately filed a motion to impeach Choi, and he resigned from his office within a matter of hours.\n\nPPP lawmakers stormed out of the assembly hall to protest the impeachment vote against Choi, who has already been acting president once before, when the opposition impeached Han Duck-soo in December. The Supreme Court overturned that impeachment and reinstalled Han as the acting president in March.\n\nLee Jae-myung, who ran for president in 2022 and narrowly lost to Yoon, announced his intention to run again on April 10. He said income inequality and economic growth would be his top priorities.\n\n\"Our economy is in dire straits. The government's role is important, but for the past three years, the government has neglected the economy,\" he said when declaring his candidacy.\n\nThe DP formally nominated Lee as its candidate on Tuesday, giving him almost 90% of its votes. According to the most recent polls he is running far ahead of potential challenges with 38% support from the public. No other candidate is polling above 10% at the moment, although the conservative vote may coalesce around a single candidate when the PPP nominates its candidate next weekend.\n\n\"Now, the people and our party colleagues gave me an opportunity to win back the presidency and build a new, real Republic of Korea. Thank you! I'll humbly uphold that ardent,\" Lee said in his acceptance speech.\n\nUnfortunately for Lee, the Supreme Court might have bounced him out of the race on Thursday by overturning a previous ruling that cleared him of charges that he made \"false statements\" during his 2022 race against Yoon.\n\nLee is under investigation for several charges that would seem fairly serious, including corruption allegations linked to a real-estate scandal from his days as governor of Gyeonggi province, but the election law case was always seen as the one that might sink him, because he has already been found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison for it.\n\nLee was accused of making false statements on two occasions in 2021. In the first instance, he claimed he was coerced by the national Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport into rezoning some property to benefit a major development project while he was mayor of the city of Seongnam.\n\nLee's critics believe he made the controversial rezoning decision for his own personal financial benefit. The Land Ministry said Lee's story of coercion was false, and the ministry's position would ultimately be accepted by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe other allegedly false statement was made in December 2021, when Lee denied his links to the massive Seongnam real estate scandal. The court found Lee's denials were demonstrably false and intended to manipulate voters.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court found Lee guilty on both charges of making false statements in November 2024 and sentenced him to a year in prison. The sentence was suspended, but under South Korean law, the verdict was enough to disqualify him from running for office for at least five years.\n\nThe Seoul High Court overturned the Central District Court's ruling in March, clearing the way for Lee to run in the June presidential election. Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court, and on Thursday they won their case, as the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's ruling.\n\nChief Justice Jo Hee-de said on Thursday that Lee's statements in October and December 2021 were \"judged to be false statements on matters important enough to ruin voters' accurate judgement on the defendant's eligibility for public office.\"\n\nLee might have one more chance to stay in the race, as the Supreme Court tossed his case back down to the appellate court level for a new ruling. The Supreme Court moved very quickly to hear Lee's case, but the appeals court could take months before issuing a new ruling.\n\nIronically, the four serious corruption cases against Lee -- the very charges he was convicted of making false statements about in 2021 -- probably will not reach the courts until long after the June election, so they are not seen as serious impediments to his run.\n\nThere was a good deal of confusion among politicians, commentators, and legal experts in South Korea on Thursday over whether Lee can continue running for president after the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nPolitical consultant Park Sung-min told Nikkei Asia on Thursday that Lee can legally continue his campaign, and he probably will, but he probably shouldn't. If the appeals court moves as quickly as the Supreme Court did, a ruling could be dropped right in the middle of the campaign that forces Lee to suspend his candidacy.\n\n\"Lee will face pressure to resign as the court allows time for a change of candidate, but I think the Democratic Party will go ahead with him,\" Park predicted.\n\nThe DP held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss Lee's fate, and decided it would stick with him. The party criticized the Supreme Court ruling and said it has no plans to name an alternative candidate.\n\nPolitical analyst Rhee Jong-hoon told Reuters that whatever the DP might be saying in public, it will almost certainly discuss a \"Plan B\" behind closed doors, possibly including an outreach to minor parties to form a coalition around a different candidate.\n\n\"The appeals court will decide whether to disqualify him to run for office or not, but the Supreme Court in effect found him guilty,\" noted Myongji University political science professor Shin Yul. \"Moderate voters, 10% of the total, will be swayed by this news.\"\n\nLee himself seemingly argued that the election should be the ultimate verdict on his actions, rendered by the South Korean people.\n\n\"It was a totally different direction of ruling from what I thought,\" he said of the Supreme Court decision. \"Law is a consensus of people, and people's will matters the most.\"",

                "title": "Adams' $115B 'Best Budget Ever' is chocked full of freebies fit for...",
                "body": "Mayor Eric Adams served up a $115 billion election year spending plan Thursday that's stuffed with voter-pleasing goodies, but that was still slammed by critics for squirreling away relatively little for a rainy day.\n\nHizzoner, who faces an uphill re-election battle, unveiled his 2026 executive budget during a campaign-like event from his alma mater Bayside High School in Queens, rather than City Hall, from which such announcements have traditionally been done.\n\n\"This is not a budget that favors the few. It is budget for all of you,\" Adams said, while flanked by students. \"In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that our fiscal Year 2026 executive budget is the best budget ever.\"\n\nThe budget lavishes $1.4 billion on programs and services that had faced cuts -- such as libraries, early child education and the City University of New York.\n\nIt also launches a universal after-school program and increases education funding by $376 million.\n\nThe spending plan is the largest Adams has proposed since taking office in 2022, with last year's executive budget proposal coming in at $111.6 billion.\n\n\"Welcome to the election year!\" said veteran campaign strategist Hank Sheinkopf, adding that incumbent mayors usually throw caution to the wind when seeking a second term.\n\n\"An election year means living in the moment. Tomorrow, next year is a long time away,\" Sheinkopf told The Post. \"It's 'spend whatever we can now.' It's like a bank robbery.\"\n\nCritics quickly pounced on Adams seemingly failing to plan for the possibility of tough economic times in the near future, from President Trump's tariffs, a widely anticipated upcoming recession and potential federal funding cuts.\n\n\"Despite being flush with cash, Mayor Eric Adams' Fiscal Year 2026 Executive Budget fails to address the dual threats of looming federal budget cuts and a possible recession,\" said Andrew Rein, president of the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group Citizens Budget Commission.\n\n\"Instead of wisely adding $1 billion in next year's General Reserve to soften the first blows of federal cuts and $2 billion to the Rainy Day Fund, the budget increases spending to an unaffordable level.\"\n\nRein said the city should have between $8 and $10 billion in reserves for potential choppy economic waters -- a sum that city budget Director Jacques Jiha agreed would be needed, if the Big Apple were in a \"doomsday\" scenario.\n\n\"We're not looking at doomsday, we're looking at a slowdown in the economy,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe we have adequate reserves.\"\n\nAdams' preliminary budget, released in January, was blasted by opponents, including in the progressive City Council, for needlessly cutting services.\n\nBut his administration maintained those slashes were necessary due to skyrocketing costs from the migrant crisis -- which Jiha said has now cost the city more than $7 billion.\n\nThe mayor had begged Albany lawmakers in February for $1.1 billion to deal with the migrant crisis, contending then that the city needed it in 12 weeks.\n\nCity Hall officials offered nary a peep about the ask since then -- and the supposed shortfall apparently has been covered by savings, with Jiha saying only \"Money is fungible\" as an explanation.\n\nThe budget announced Thursday is Adams' first since the crisis largely subsided, and includes these spending increases and reversed cuts:\n\n\"Adams is using this budget to promote his re-election. He doesn't want to have much of a fight with the council,\" said Nicole Gelinas, senior fellow at the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"It's pre-emptive capitulation to the council,\" she added, noting Adams was proposing $1.7 billion more in spending compared to his preliminary budget.\n\n\"Adams is blowing out the agency spending,\" Gelinas said. \"[He] is squandering the last of his budget credibility.\"\n\nNot all programs and departments saw a funding increase. The following budget cuts were included in the plan:\n\nTalks with City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is not related to Hizzoner and is running for the Democratic mayoral nomination, will continue until the June 30 deadline to pass the budget.\n\nAdams' plan offered plenty of fodder from candidates hoping to boot him from Gracie Mansion, such as City Comptroller Brad Lander -- who claimed the mayor was \"failing to protect New Yorkers\" by not putting more cash in reserves.\n\nFormer city comptroller and current mayoral candidate Scott Stringer also blasted Adams for failing to prepare for a potential \"extraordinary loss of funding for New York City.\"\n\nAdrienne Adams offered less gloom and doom -- though she still cautioned against getting too comfortable.\n\n\"I think that the budget right now is good, but we can never be too certain about what is coming around the corner with this Trump administration,\" she said.\n\nAdams, who boasted of confronting then-President Joe Biden for migrant funding, hasn't been nearly as vocal about his growing ally Trump.\n\nHe said he hasn't been in contact with the White House, even as he acknowledged that the current global climate was creating \"uncharted waters.\"\n\nAdams' top deputy, however, was quick to put a positive spin on the potential financial woes.\n\n\"We are best positioned to address with Washington those issues going forward,\" said First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro. \"Even asking a question about a doomsday scenario is to be with those pessimistic and political opportunists who don't bet on New York, who are saying, 'The sky is falling.'",

                "body": "Warning: This story contains an image of a Nazi symbol.\n\nThousands of campaign posters -- cable-tied to fences and lining the streets -- each emblazoned with a candidate's name and portrait.\n\nAnd while stealing or vandalising corflutes isn't new, political experts are warning dirty tactics are becoming more common in some tight electorates.\n\nElection signs have been marked with swastikas or offensive slurs, burned, vandalised, smeared with excrement, stomped on and shredded, especially in marginal seats.\n\nPolitics lecturer Dr Blair Williams from Monash University said the high volume of reports, and their severity, was worrying.\n\n\"Much of what we're seeing on corflutes kind of relates to that increased polarisation, increased normalisation of hate speech,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not surprising that we're seeing that trickle down into politics on the streets.\"\n\nSome vandals caught on camera\n\nIn the marginal seat of Mackellar in Sydney's north, independent MP Sophie Scamps said about 500 of her electoral signs had been \"slashed and destroyed\" over the past month.\n\nPictures circulating on social media show a man appearing to take down a number of Ms Scamps's posters and using a knife to shred them.\n\n\"People find such aggression at best puerile, at worst deeply threatening,\" Ms Scamps said.\n\n\"The electorate has been covered in bright yellow, denigrating and misleading posters and ads about me. After the actions of Professor Malham in Kooyong have illustrated, I'm not sure we can say this is just healthy democracy.\"\n\nMs Scamps was referring to Melbourne neurosurgeon, Professor Greg Malham, after a video circulated of a man tearing down a poster of independent MP Monique Ryan in the marginal Melbourne seat of Kooyong.\n\nNine Newspapers reported Professor Malham admitted to being the man in the video and apologised.\n\nMs Ryan told the ABC the video was \"deeply concerning\" but was far from an isolated incident.\n\n\"We've seen groups from both within and outside Kooyong stoking division through aggressively negative advertising,\" she said.\n\n\"It's creating a climate of hostility that is distressing to candidates, volunteers, and the broader community.\"\n\n\"There's no place in Australian electoral campaigns or society for violence and aggression.\"\n\nMs Ryan said more than 200 of her corflutes had been torn down and defaced, sometimes with very distressing messages or symbols put on them.\n\n\"It's been a really tough election campaign nationally, things are heightened, and there's a lot of tension,\" she said.\n\nMs Ryan herself copped criticism earlier in the campaign, after her husband was caught on video removing a sign of her Liberal opponent Amelia Hamer.\n\nPeter Jordan apologised for the incident, saying he believed the sign was illegally placed.\n\n'Violent' vandalism and incidents of physical assault\n\nSome attacks on signage have also turned physically violent.\n\nIn Ashfield in Sydney's inner west, a 79-year-old man was taken to hospital in a serious condition after an alleged assault outside a polling booth in Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's electorate of Grayndler.\n\nThe ABC understands the elderly man was confronted after defacing one of Mr Albanese's corflutes. A 17-year-old boy has been charged over the incident.\n\nElsewhere in Sydney, in the seat of Bennelong, a 30-year-old man was charged with intimidation after kicking a number of signs and allegedly becoming aggressive towards volunteers at the booth.\n\nA number of police investigations have been conducted in the hotly-contested seat of Calare in the New South Wales Central West, where the Nationals are hoping to win against sitting independent Andrew Gee.\n\nIn a statement, Detective Inspector Jason Darcy said there had been examples of malicious damage and people being abusive to others at a number of polling centres across NSW \"due to heightened emotions ahead of the federal election\".\n\n\"The message is clear -- this is not what police want to see and there will be no tolerance for any behaviour that could harm others at any time anywhere,\" Detective Inspector Darcy said.\n\n\"It is disappointing when it seems to be conveying a bit of violence,\" independent candidate Kate Hook said.\n\nOther corflutes in the electorate have been targeted with racist remarks or stolen, while Nazi symbols have been scrawled on billboards.\n\nIn another marginal seat, Liberal candidate for Wentworth Ro Knox has also had hundreds of posters vandalised or stolen -- some even set on fire or smeared with animal faeces.\n\nMany in the Sydney seat, currently held by independent Allegra Spender, have also been vandalised with anti-Semitic symbols and language.\n\nMs Knox said she understood many residents were fed up with the \"poster wars\", and pledged to not use campaign posters on public property in the next campaign if elected.\n\n\"We're all over the waste, the visual pollution, the silly games where people are tearing down and defacing posters,\" she said.\n\nDeputy Greens leader Mehreen Faruqi, whose signs have been targeted, said the problem was getting worse.\n\n\"What's happening out there clearly goes beyond ordinary vandalism -- this is politically motivated hate,\" she told the ABC.\n\nAustralian National University political marketing lecturer Andrew Hughes said the worst instances of vandalism appeared to be in seats with three of four candidates, particularly where a teal or independent candidate was running.\n\n\"All of a sudden a lot of these races are too hard to call so people revert to, sadly, aggressive behaviour like this to get their candidate elected again,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to accept we're entering a new era where traditional two-way races between major party candidates will become a thing of the past in some areas, even areas where we thought that wouldn't happen like Calare, like Wannon.\"\n\nMr Hughes said the behaviour actually worked against the candidate the vandal thought they were helping.\n\n\"You notice the sign left untouched and then people start thinking: 'Hang on, that party's playing dirty,'\" he said.\n\nPauline Hanson's One Nation party has also been targeted, with a man who hid his face with a mask caught on video slashing through candidate Stuart Bonds's corflutes in the electorate of Hunter in New South Wales.\n\nFrustrated locals or far-right actors?\n\nSo who is behind the attacks? Dr Blair Williams said the culprits were likely a mix of bored teenagers, supporters of political opponents, and extremists. And in many instances, it's hard to tell.\n\n\"I can imagine some of the people stealing signs would be frustrated community members ... whether it be the cost of living crisis or what's happening in Gaza,\" she said.\n\n\"But then there are the more insidious actors. In the last federal election some corflutes were defaced by neo-Nazi groups with neo-Nazi signage, and you're seeing some more hate speech vandalism as well this election.\"",

                "body": "The United States has finally acknowledged the truth: Sex-change treatments endanger children.\n\nOn Thursday, the federal Department of Health and Human Services issued the world's most comprehensive report on the topic to date -- a definitive 400-page evidentiary and ethical takedown.\n\nTransgender activists have long relied on the support of the US government -- or at least its silence -- to protect their claimed medical and moral legitimacy and continue treatment on children as young as age 8.\n\nNow they have nowhere to turn but the fringe, which is where their ideology arose and ought to return.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about this report is that it took so long.\n\nOther nations, especially in Europe, have conducted their own reviews of the evidence in recent years.\n\nThey have broadly concluded that treatments like puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex-change surgeries have more documented risks than potential benefits for children.\n\nLast summer, for example, Great Britain all but banned the use of puberty blockers -- the first and foundational treatment in child sex-change procedures -- after the publication of a National Health Service report by Dr. Hilary Cass.\n\nYet the US government has refused to grapple with the evidence, much less admit it, until now.\n\nIn the meantime, at least 14,000 American children have been subjected to these interventions, as our organization has documented.\n\nThe HHS report notes from the start that medical practitioners have a \"professional and ethical obligation to protect and promote their patients' health.\"\n\nThat obligation strongly counsels against hormones and surgeries for children, since, as the report notes, there's little evidence of benefits of sex-change treatments -- but plenty of proof of their harm.\n\nThe evidence shows that sex changes for children can lead to infertility, sterility, cognitive problems, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, mental-health disorders and more.\n\nAnd, as the report also notes, additional suffering may soon come to light -- because existing studies fail \"to systematically track and report harms.\"\n\nWe already know, as the report makes clear, that child sex changes are happening amid a broader mental-health crisis among kids.\n\nPsychotherapy, not experimental drugs and invasive surgeries, is necessary to treat underlying mental issues like anxiety and depression.\n\nActivists have mischaracterized psychotherapy as \"conversion therapy,\" the HHS report notes -- yet Britain and the Scandinavian countries now recommend these non-invasive treatments as the primary intervention.\n\nThe unnamed authors don't mince words about what medical professionals should -- and shouldn't -- do in cases of gender distress.\n\n\"When medical interventions pose unnecessary, disproportionate risks of harm, health care providers should refuse to offer them,\" they instruct, \"even when they are preferred, requested, or demanded by patients.\"\n\nFailing to heed this guidance, they write, threatens the foundations of medicine itself.\n\nHonest medical practitioners and experts have known from the beginning that child transgender treatments are risky and largely experimental.\n\nYet honesty was never the goal for many activists, as the HHS report also shows.\n\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which publishes the most widely used child treatment guidelines, \"suppressed systematic reviews its leaders believed would undermine its favored treatment approach.\"\n\nWPATH's guideline developers also \"eliminated nearly all recommended age minimums for medical and surgical interventions in response to political pressures.\"\n\nThis is the definition of putting ideology ahead of evidence.\n\nNow the HHS report must shape government action.\n\nIt provides the necessary scientific support to implement President Trump's January order to \"take all appropriate actions to end\" treatments that endanger children.\n\nThat could include ending Medicare and Medicaid coverage of such treatments -- and perhaps private health-insurance coverage as well.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget has sought to block federal research and education grants to institutions that perform child sex-change treatments, and the report adds weight to that effort.\n\nThe findings should also spur National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to release the results of its decade-long study on the effects of puberty-blocking drugs on children.\n\nThat study's author, prominent transgender activist Johanna Olson-Kennedy, has refused to release the data -- while admitting they didn't show promised mental-health improvements.\n\nNIH should now fund new, non-biased studies to analyze the effects of sex-change treatments on those who received them as children, including the rates of regret and the prevalence of de-transitioning.\n\nThursday's report proves that our federal government is finally willing to put medical science ahead of gender activism.\n\nWashington has sided with ideologues for too long, giving cover to the notion that sex changes for children are consequence-free and medically necessary.\n\nIn fact, the proven harms outweigh unproven benefits.\n\nBy finally speaking truth to the activists' power, the United States has taken the most important global step yet in protecting children from transgender ideology.",

                "title": "China Detains Investors Who Complained About State-Linked Financial Scam",
                "body": "Chinese police have reportedly detained dozens of small investors who were scammed out of their money by a state-linked investment group, accusing the victims of acting on behalf of \"overseas anti-China forces\" by airing their grievances in public.\n\nAt the heart of the controversy is the Shandong Jianghaihui Financial Group, a government-supported investment company headquartered in Shandong province. The company abruptly ceased operations in March, and its founder fled to the United States along with his wife.\n\nRoughly 100,000 small investors were angered to discover their $2.74 billion in investments went up in smoke when the financial group dissolved. When the Chinese government seemed disinclined to do anything about it, the defrauded investors began talking to reporters -- and the government very quickly did something about them.\n\nRadio Free Asia (RFA) reported on Wednesday that dozens of victimized depositors, most of them women, have been detained by the police after they tried to get around the Communist regime's embargo on news coverage of the Shandong Jianghaihui story by talking to foreign reporters, including RFA itself.\n\n\"All the people who had contacted you from here were detained,\" a source in Shandong told RFA. \"They said we were being used by international anti-China forces and that we were all committing crimes.\"\n\nAccording to RFA's sources, Chinese police looked for news reports about the Shandong financial collapse on foreign websites, got the names of the sources for their stories, and started rounding them up. Some of the unfortunate depositors were released within a matter of days, while others are in detention to this day.\n\nThere are several reasons the Chinese Communist Party regards this story as so troublesome. The regime is deeply worried about deteriorating public morale as U.S. tariffs bite into China's export economy, so this is an exceptionally bad time for dozens of middle-class women to be talking about how an unscrupulous financial company stole their life savings.\n\nEven worse, the anguished depositors say the government is partly to blame for the Shandong scandal, because oversight of the company was very lax, to say the least. Victims say they invested with the company because they believed its activities were part of the Chinese government's efforts to stimulate private enterprise.\n\nRFA noted a group of defrauded investors wrote the Chinese Communist Party's disciplinary commission and the Ministry of Public Security to ask for help recovering their money. Their letter pointedly asked why the government was describing Shandong Jianghaihui's activities as \"illegal fundraising,\" as if they were some sort of private charitable organization, rather than \"contract fraud.\"\n\nThe reason for this elusive rhetoric is most likely that the financial company held government-issued business licenses and passed government audits for years -- just like a number of other financial companies over the past few years whose owners stuffed company cash in their pockets and fled overseas right before their investment schemes came crashing down.\n\nAnother example was a company called Zhongrong International Trust, which held $108 billion in assets at its peak, but went bankrupt in 2024. Chinese officials began the process of liquidating the trust's assets on April 15, prompting large protests by empty-handed investors that were studiously ignored by Chinese state media -- but not by dissidents such as the famed \"Mr. Li Is Not Your Teacher\" social media account:\n\nMr. Li noted that over a hundred of the demonstrators, including \"the elderly, women, and cancer patients,\" were \"violently dragged\" from the scene of the Zhongrong Trust protest by police.",

                "title": "Exclusive  --  Leading Romanian Politician: Let's 'Make Europe Great Again'",
                "body": "WASHINGTON -- George Simion, the leading candidate in the upcoming Romanian presidential election, told Breitbart News that if he wins and if a similarly conservative anti-globalist candidate wins in Poland in presidential elections in May that President Donald Trump will have two major new allies in the European Union.\n\nRomania had elected hardline conservative anti-globalist Calin Georgescu late last year, but the election was called off and nullified after he was accused of being pro-Russian. Romanians scheduled a new election for May, and Simion -- who has promised Georgescu a position in his government if he wins -- has emerged as the front-running candidate. Protests have erupted across Romania with people objecting to interference in their elections from Brussels, globalist plotters who canceled Georgescu's victory.\n\nSimion was in Washington in mid-April to meet with top conservatives close to President Trump and during his visit sat for an exclusive interview with Breitbart News.\n\nAsked about the anger from the people that the international community has seen since Georgescu's victory was nullified by globalists, Simion told Breitbart News: \"Would't you be?\"\n\n\"You would storm onto the streets and you would be protesting in a manner that you would harangue them -- the guys that did the coup d'etat, the establishment guys, the deep state guys combined with our public government,\" Simeon told Breitbart News. \"They were losing big time -- they were organizing the elections and they lost big time. So they renounced the elections because they didn't like Georgescu's stances. They said he had pro Russia stances. It's arguable, but -- it's arguable that Donald Trump did this. We have a globalist ambassador here and the U.S. has a globalist ambassador to Bucharest, also a Biden woman, they said Simion was in Russia making antisemitic statements. He was phoning people around Washington. I've never been to Moscow. They said okay Georgescu had pro-Russian stances. Last I checked, this is not forbidden by the Constitution and the electoral law. Of course, I would never have pro-Russian stances. Nobody in Romania would win with a pro-Russian stances actually. Russia did the biggest harm to us in the last hundred years in order to have a population that loves Russia or Russians.\"\n\nSimion is not concerned that they might be able to do to him what they did to Georgescu because now the whole world is watching and Brussels-based globalists and other far-left actors in Romania cannot get away with it. But he does expect some leftist shenanigans and is prepared to fight it out to victory.\n\n\"It would be too much now that everybody is looking,\" Simion said. \"We have international observers. Nobody was expecting this inside a country inside the European Union. It is too much to annul the election. They will try some scams. They will try to rig some votes and steal some ballots. This is usual for them because they are liars and they are thieves. They will do anything in their power to keep their power.\"\n\nSimion and several other candidates will face off on Sunday in a first round of the presidential election. The top two vote-getters in the May 4 contest will advance to a May 18 final head-to-head election, and Brussels is quite literally freaking out that Simion might win. Recent polling has had him double digits ahead of everyone else in the race, but he's still only in the mid-30s, so while he is expected to finish atop the field on Sunday, he's got to then within two weeks really close it down and win big getting majority support on May 18 to become Romania's next president.\n\n\"Polls will be however you have some psychological phenomenon, silent spiral, but I'm leading big time yes,\" Simion said when asked about the polls, adding that he's ready for a real fight with the globalist elites in the home stretch.\n\n\"They were expecting, 'okay, we will dismantle him through the MSM. We will kill him,'\" Simion said. \"This is why in this election people are already going to vote. Some people are already casting their ballots in the U.S. and Canada abroad -- the Romanians abroad -- some of them already voted in the voting stations, not by mail. So yes, this is one of the reasons I'm here, to spread the word and sound the alarm that they are not democrats but authoritarian tyrants that want to control Romania and they are allowed and are ordered by unelected bureaucrats in Brussels.\"\n\nRomania is one of the European Union's 27 member nations. Located in Eastern Europe, it borders Ukraine, and the threats from Russia are very real to Romanians. Romanians have gone decades without a leader like Simion -- and he has come to lead a movement of disenfranchised Romanians who feel like their votes were stolen last year.\n\n\"First of all, it's not about me. It's the fact I'm continuing this sovereign-ist movement, a representative of this sovereign-ist movement started by Calin Georgescu,\" Simion told Breitbart News. \"I'm his replacement. People are upset and they want their president back. Their president is Georgescu and we will bring him to power through these elections and all the means that is necessary. Second, of course, it will be the first time in Romania in the last 35 years where we have had a patriotic, sovereign-ist president. So this is the reason they are voting for me. I'm 38 years old. I will fight. The ideals of the Romanian Revolution of 1989 will be transformed into reality. People died hoping that we have free elections, democracy, and freedom. We forgot about this. It turns out the fight continues for freedom and all of our lives. You must fight generation to generation, and you must win. So this is what we are doing right now.\"\n\nSimion said the movement politics of working class people rejecting globalists -- what's happened in the U.S. and might be happening in Romania -- is \"of course a reaction, an allergic reaction or an antibody reaction, from the people against all these crazy ideas and ideologies and crazy stuff like lies about how cows are polluting and we must kill the cows, we must kill the grandmothers, and we must kill everybody because we have a death culture and Satanic ideology behind us.\"\n\n\"It's common sense that people are supporting and returning to their roots and returning to normality,\" Simion said.\n\nSimion said he knows that if he wins he will be the most likely of any of the remaining candidates to have warm relations with President Trump and the United States. Simion also mentioned that Poland, which is also having its presidential elections in May, has a similar opportunity to elect a fresh young anti-globalist conservative. The two of them are essentially running as a ticket, freaking Brussels out even more.\n\n\"I am not hoping -- I know,\" he replied when asked if he hopes to have close relations with Trump if he wins. \"I am the only one who has channels to the Trump administration. The Trump administration doesn't want to talk with our public government selected by Brussels. Yes, America would be our main focus and key strategic partner. We are the natural partners and we are ideologically the same with the MAGA movement. You can consider me a MAGA candidate -- the only MAGA candidate in the Romanian election. But what's more interesting and important is I'm also supporting the Polish candidate in their presidential elections on the same day in Poland. Karol Nawrocki, the successor of Andrzej Duda, is the candidate of the party of Mr. [Jarosław] Kaczyński. We would be two presidents that if we win the elections in May would be pro-Trump presidents, pro-freedom presidents, and against the Brussels bureaucracy.\"\n\nWhen Breitbart News told him of the very positive view of President Trump this reporter found in Greece recently, Simion said Trump has far more support across Europe than globalist institutions like the establishment media would have anyone believe. He mentioned how close he and other conservative leaders are with Italian Prime Minister Giorgia Meloni -- this interview was conducted right after Meloni's visit to the White House.\n\n\"I'm sure this is the fact,\" Simion said. \"In Romania, President Trump in their fake polls from the 27 states has the biggest approval rating of his actions. I think what we started and continue the MAGA movement with MEGA -- Make Europe Great Again, I'm the co-founder of that in Europe -- we will be victorious. I think it's a matter of time after winning in Romania and Poland before we have a majority of governments across the 27 states of the European Union that are pro-Trump and MAGA-oriented. This is what we have to do -- we are in the European party of Giorgia Meloni. Giorgia is our dear friend and leader. Yesterday she was at the White House.\"\n\nSimion said he agrees with Meloni's and Trump's comments from the Italian leader's White House visit where they pledged to Make the West Great Again. He also said how he and others across Europe believe the globalists at the European Union headquarters in Brussels need to be put in check.\n\n\"Absolutely, when you define the West, you talk about Italy,\" Simion said. \"And she managed to make it, she has it in Italy many times, Italia Protaginsta. She managed in only two years to do it and be a model. So yes, I would think we would have a series of pro-Trump leaders across Europe who are winning and will deal directly with the Trump administration and which will stop Ursula von der Leyen and these nasty people that remind us of crooked Joe Biden.\"\n\nSimion added that given that Romania shares a border with Ukraine, his country has unique credibility among European Union member nations on how to deal with Russia and Ukraine. He said that Russia is a malign actor in the region and cannot be trusted.\n\n\"Russia is a big danger for us, for Poland, for the Baltic states,\" Simion said. \"We must stop Russia. But what's happening right now is not stopping Russia, it's only making Russia become an important actor again. This war doesn't go anywhere. Of course it's condemnable and you cannot ask for a country to give up territory. But we have to deescalate the conflict. I hope and pray President Trump will do so and obtain a ceasefire and peace negotiations. It's the only way possible, with new security guarantees for the next 40 to 50 years so that Russia doesn't do this again because it's like an MO from their part... We need new security guarantees.\"\n\nWhen it comes to Trump's tariffs, Simion said Trump's speeches throughout his career made it \"obvious\" the president was focused on China with them.\n\n\"It's obvious that the tariffs were not targeting the European countries,\" Simion said. \"It was just stupid Emmanuel Macron who tried to put tariffs on the digital products from the United States and I'm sure we will find a solution in the economic relationship with the United States. Of course, the tariffs are about China -- only if you listen to the speeches of the last 10 years of Donald Trump you would understand this. But some pretend they do not understand. So if America wouldn't have done this now, in 10 years Americans wouldn't be the biggest power in the world. It's something you need to do, and it's something we need to do, because we stopped producing in our countries and we have had some not so smart people influencing things like experts and university professors who were saying you could live like this forever not producing anything but having the good life. We should get our jobs back and we should get our production back in Europe and in America and only then we can really stop others from growing.\"\n\nHe said too that he hopes after the elections in Romania and Poland that are upcoming that Trump and the U.S. will have friends in the presidencies of two major European nations in just a few weeks' time.\n\n\"I'm hopeful that after the end of May, America will regain two of its important partners -- both Romania and Poland,\" Simion said. \"We are committed not only to the idea of friendship between Romania and the United States but also to the values I know on which we stand -- freedom of speech, democracy, common sense.\"",

                "body": "Taxpayers may get their gooses cooked paying for a duck massacre.\n\nA Long Island duck farm is asking for the federal government to quack up $1 million after it euthanized 100,000 of its flocks over bird flu fears, documents show.\n\nCrescent Duck Farm, which supplies 4% of the nation's duck meat, has already received $150,000 from the USDA and is asking for more after it put down tens of thousands of birds -- and now animal activists are slamming the cost and the carnage.\n\nThe farm used carbon dioxide foam, then snapped the necks of surviving birds with a handheld scissor-like tool called the Koechner Euthanizing Device, according to USDA documents.\n\n\"If you see videos of it, it looks like a scene from a horror movie,\" Ben Williamson, the executive director of Animal Outlook, told The Post of the foam. \"It doesn't knock them out, it doesn't stun them. They essentially will suffocate, and will be conscious while they're suffocating ... and then the ones who survive have their necks rung by these devices.\"\n\nBut Crescent Duck Farm owner Doug Corwin told The Post the UDSA ended up using a different killing method, and the farm \"had nothing to do with whatever was decided upon.\"\n\n\"This was a heartbreaking thing,\" he added. \"We had no standing in that.\"\n\nA request for comment from the USDA was not immediately returned.\n\nThe 116-year-old farm on the North Fork estimated it was owed $811,635 from the government due to the mass culling after 700 Peking ducks died from the virus in January, records show.\n\nThe requested funds were used for sanitization, disposal and replacement of roughly $166,365 in losses, the farm said. Corwin told The Post the USDA has reimbursed to date \"about 10%\" of what the flock was worth,\" or about $150,000, and is expecting more.\n\nLong Island animal activists weren't taken by the sob story -- or use of government cash.\n\n\"New Yorkers don't go to work with the intention of spending our hard-earned money on a multimillion-dollar enterprise that kills a million 6-week-old ducklings a year while they're still peeping,\" said John Di Leonardo, executive director of animal rights group Humane Long Island.\n\nPoultry farms and live markets are mandated to kill inventory when highly-contagious bird flu is detected, and dozens of outbreaks have torn through New York State in 2025, according to the USDA website.\n\nThe first case of bird flu in the U.S. was detected in 2022 and has since resulted in the deaths of an estimated 166 million birds. Toxic carbon dioxide foam is used in culling about half of the time, per a USDA report, and require secondary measures to kill surviving ducks about 29% of the time.\n\nDespite the culling at Crescent, The Post reported in February that more than 3,700 new ducklings hatched at an off-site location.\n\nThe ducks can return to the North Fork once barns are found to be free of any active avian flu DNA, Corwin said, adding the barns were last tested Monday.\n\n\"The ducks are nine weeks old and in good shape,\" Corwin said. \"We're hoping to bring them home when we can - when its 100% safe to do so.\"\n\nWilliamson told The Post he will be presenting an offer to the farm on Thursday to help the business transition to crop production instead, which he deems more \"humane and sustainable\" than duck farming.\n\n\"While we recognize Crescent Duck Farm's historical significance to Long Island, the documents we've obtained reveal not just the financial cost to taxpayers, but also the grim reality of how these birds met their end,\" he said.\n\nCorwin, however, balked at the idea of scrapping his beloved ducks for farming lettuce and other vegetation.\n\n\"It's going to take me a year and a half to get any income off of this place [after the culling],\" he said. \"I'd be better off to bulldoze every barn we have and put it up for sale, but I'm a farmer at heart.\"",

                "title": "Maduro Regime Denies Colombia's Claim that Marxist Terrorist Group Is Operating in Venezuela",
                "body": "The socialist regime of Venezuelan President Nicolás Maduro rejected claims made by far-left Colombian President Gustavo Petro on Wednesday that Colombian drug trafficker Jobanis de Jesús Ávila Villadiego has formed an alliance with the National Liberation Army (ELN) Marxist terror group in Venezuelan territory.\n\nVilladiego, also known as Chiquito malo (\"Bad Little Boy\"), is the current leader of the Colombian Clan del Golfo drug cartel, succeeding its previous leader Dairo \"Otoniel\" Úsuga David after he was arrested in 2021 and sentenced to 45 years on numerous drug trafficking charges in 2023.\n\nPetro, through a Wednesday Twitter post, asserted that Villadiego had formed an alliance with ELN inside the territory of neighboring Venezuela. Petro added that Colombian authorities have already seized 32 tons of cocaine from the Catatumbo region and arrested \"several mayors and politicians who were helping the drug traffickers.\"\n\n\"Crop substitution in Catatumbo is essential to achieving peace. Violence in the Caribbean revolves around ports and extortion. I've decided to change the entire port administration,\" Petro's message said.\n\n\"There will be a special meeting today to intensify the offensive against Clan del Golfo,\" he continued. \"I expect from the Caribbean citizens, and with due confidentiality, information to find the leaders of the Clan.\"\n\nPetro's statements drew fierce criticism from the socialist Maduro regime.\n\nThe Colombian newspaper El Tiempo reported on Wednesday that it had obtained a copy of an official letter sent by the Venezuelan Foreign Ministry to its Colombian counterpart protesting Petro's social media post and rejecting being held responsible for \"dynamics that have their origin and expansion in Colombian territory.\"\n\n\"Such statements, deeply inconsiderate, constitute a petty expression that ignores the firm commitment of the Venezuelan State to the fight against drug trafficking and transnational organized crime, as well as the important operational efforts that the Bolivarian National Armed Forces (FANB) have been carrying out for weeks to safeguard national sovereignty,\" the note said.\n\nColombia's Catatumbo region is presently the epicenter of a gruesome conflict between the Marxist ELN and the equally Marxist Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) terrorist group over control of the region's coca leaf crops, the main ingredient used in the manufacture of cocaine.\n\nThe conflict dramatically escalated in mid-January after ELN broke a tacit \"non-aggression\" pact that both terror groups had agreed upon in 2022 and which established limits on their respective areas of influence and illicit economic activities. The ongoing conflict left nearly 100 dead and over 60,000 local residents displaced as of March.\n\nSeveral reports published in recent years have denounced that ELN began a process of expansion in Venezuelan territory that has effectively turned it into a \"bi-national\" guerilla force.\n\nAlthough ELN has historically used Venezuela as a \"refuge\" from Colombian law enforcement operations since the 1980s, the Marxist terrorist group established a firm foothold in Venezuelan territory thanks to its friendly ties with the Venezuelan socialist regime, first established under the auspices of late dictator Hugo Chávez.\n\nUnnamed human rights activists cited by the Venezuelan outlet Armando Info in April explained that ELN has a permanent presence \"along the entire border\" between both countries, especially in the neighboring states of Zulia and Táchira, and has used Venezuelan territory to stage operations in Colombia since at least 2020.\n\nVenezuelan Interior Minister -- and actively wanted drug lord -- Diosdado Cabello refuted Petro's accusations during the latest broadcast of his weekly socialist show Hitting with the Mallet, urging Petro to \"not bring Venezuela into your problems.\"\n\n\"I always ask myself why he [Petro] has to drag Venezuela into his schemes. In Venezuela we are fighting a frontal battle against all the drug trafficking, paramilitary, and terrorist mafias. What was achieved in Venezuela was thanks to Venezuelan Intelligence and Counterintelligence,\" Cabello claimed.\n\n\"Why does the President of Colombia have to meddle with Venezuela? The problem is where the drugs are produced. Venezuela has deployed more than 5,000 troops of the Bolivarian National Armed Forces and police throughout its territory,\" he added.\n\nCabello urged Colombia to stop blaming the Venezuelan regime and describing the neighboring country as \"neighbors who throw stones at neighbors and you have to respond.\"",

Only the top-spec Hybrid+ Essence exceeds the $30,000 mark.\n\nThe MG 3 retains a comprehensive suite of standard safety gear, which includes lane-keep assist, blind-spot monitoring, and rear cross-traffic alert - though the latter two have been removed from the Vibe.\n\nHundreds of new car deals are available through CarExpert right now. Get the experts on your side and score a great deal. Browse now.\n\nThe MG 3 is by far the best-selling vehicle in its segment, holding a 48.4 per cent share in 2024 despite the price increase from the old generation to the new.\n\nWith 3081 sales to the end of March 2025, the MG 3 is up 6.6 per cent on the 2889 figure during the same period last year, and the addition of a cheaper version should contribute to a further increase in sales.\n\nIts closest rivals are now just the Picanto and Suzuki Swift Hybrid, as the cheapest range-opening variants of the Mazda 2 sedan and hatch were axed earlier this year, increasing the model's starting price by more than $4000.\n\nThe MG 3 Vibe is now considerably cheaper than the base Swift Hybrid manual ($24,490 before on-roads) and, as mentioned, slightly more expensive than the Picanto Sport manual.\n\nAt the top of the range, the MG 3 Hybrid+ Excite remains the cheapest electrified vehicle in Australia at $27,990 before on-roads, undercutting the Toyota Yaris Ascent Sport Hybrid at $28,500 before on-roads.\n\nPricing\n\nPrices are unchanged from 2024, except that the addition of the range-opening Vibe variant brings the new MG 3 range below $22,000 for the first time. Drive-away offers are currently in place across the range, so we've listed prices before on-roads below for clarity.\n\nDrivetrains and EfficiencyDimensionsServicing and Warranty\n\nMG Motor Australia offers a market-leading 10-year, 250,000km warranty for its model range, and MG 3 service intervals are 12 months or 10,000km, whichever comes first.\n\nMG's service pricing guide differs between petrol and Hybrid+ MG 3 models, with individual prices detailed below:\n\nSafety\n\nThe MG 3 wears a three-star ANCAP safety rating, based on testing conducted in 2024.\n\nStandard safety equipment includes:\n\n6 airbagsAutonomous emergency braking (AEB)Lane departure warningLane-keep assistEmergency lane-keep assistAdaptive cruise controlIntelligent cruise assistIntelligent speed assistReversing cameraRear parking sensorsTyre pressure monitoring\n\nMG 3 Excite adds:\n\nBlind spot monitoringRear cross-traffic assist\n\nThe MG 3 Essence and Hybrid+ Essence are the only two grades to receive a surround-view camera.\n\nStandard Equipment\n\nThere are now three distinct MG 3 trim levels, but only the top two are available with the Hybrid+ powertrain.\n\n2025 MG 3 Vibe equipment highlights:\n\n15-inch steel wheelsTyre repair kitHalogen headlightsLED daytime running lightsAutomatic headlightsRear fog lightElectronic parking brakeAuto-holdTraditional gear selector10.25-inch touchscreen infotainment systemWired Apple CarPlay and Android Auto7.0-inch instrument cluster screen6-speaker sound system6-way manual driver's seat adjustment4-way manual passenger seat adjustmentPolyurethane steering wheelCloth upholsterySingle-zone climate control\n\nMG 3 Excite adds:\n\n16-inch alloy wheelsSpace-saver spare wheelPower-folding, heated side mirrorsPush-button startRear air vent\n\nMG 3 Hybrid+ Excite adds:\n\nTyre repair kit (in lieu of spare tyre)Dial-type gear selector3 drive modesPedestrian warning sound - external speakerAuto climate control\n\nMG 3 Essence adds (over Excite):\n\nProjector LED headlightsRain-sensing wipersSunroofLeatherette and cloth trimLeather-wrapped steering wheelSunglass compartmentRear map pocketsSatellite navigationDAB+ digital radioConnected mobile services (iSmart compatibility)Keyless entryOptions\n\nOnly the range-topping MG 3 Hybrid+ Essence is available with a white interior, a $500 option over the standard black interior.\n\nColours\n\nSeven exterior paint colours are available for the MG 3, and four command a $500 premium.\n\nNo-cost colours:\n\nDover WhitePastel YellowBrighton Blue Metallic\n\nPremium colours ($500 each):\n\nSloane Silver MetallicHampstead Grey MetallicBlack Pearl MetallicDiamond Red Metallic\n\nMORE: Everything MG 3\n\nOriginally published as 2025 MG 3 price and specs: More affordable entry variant joins hatch range\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

Whether in a tree or harbored in an activist judge's house, if you are here illegally, ICE will find you, arrest you, and you will be deported.\"\n\nMore than 150,000 illegal aliens have been apprehended in the U.S. since President Trump took office, many of whom have serious criminal histories.",

(Credit: ICE)\n\nFederal authorities on Thursday searched the California home of a suspect accused of doxxing U.S. Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents.\n\nThe Department of Homeland Security and the U.S. Secret Service served a search warrant on the Irvine home of the unidentified suspect, who was not home at the time.\n\nNo arrests were made.\n\nICE TOUTS RECORD-BREAKING IMMIGRATION ENFORCEMENT DURING TRUMP'S FIRST 100 DAYS\n\nAuthorities told Fox News the suspect lives with his parents and was previously arrested during an anti-Israel protest on the University of California, Irvine, campus last year.\n\nHe is accused of posting fliers in various Southern California neighborhoods with the names, photos, phone numbers and locations of ICE officers working in the region.\n\nDEMOCRAT LAWMAKER DEMANDS CONGRESS ACT ON SECURING US BORDER AFTER 'TRANSPARENT' ICE FACILITY VISIT\n\n\"The men and women of ICE signed up to do a law enforcement mission, and that's what they're doing. They're out there making communities safer,\" acting ICE Director Todd Lyons told Fox News. \"I take it personally because if you have a problem with the men and women of ICE, take it up at Congress, change the federal law or, you know, take it up with me. I represent them, but don't put their families at risk. Don't put them at risk just because they're out there doing their job.\"\n\nEarlier this year, anti-ICE activists began putting up posters featuring the personal information of ICE and Homeland Security Investigations (HSI) officers working in the Los Angeles and Southern California area.\n\n\"CAREFUL WITH THESE FACES,\" the posters said in Spanish.\n\n\"These armed agents work in Southern California. ICE and HSI racially terrorize and criminalize entire communities with their policies. They kidnap people from their homes and from the streets, separating families and fracturing communities. Many people have died while locked up in jails, prisons, and detention centers,\" the posters say.\n\nThe posters were displayed after the Trump administration began arresting and deporting criminal illegal immigrants, a major hallmark of President Donald Trump's campaign.\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"These pathetic activists are putting targets on the backs of our law enforcement as they shield MS-13, Tren De Aragua and other vicious gangs that traffic women and children, kidnap for ransom and poison Americans with lethal drugs,\" a Homeland Security spokesperson told Fox News in a statement at the time.\n\n\"These individuals will be held accountable for obstructing the law and justice.

                "body": "The U.S. Justice Department filed lawsuits against four states this week, claiming their climate actions conflict with federal authority and President Donald Trump's energy dominance agenda.\n\nThe DOJ on Wednesday filed lawsuits against Hawaii and Michigan over their planned legal action against fossil fuel companies for harms caused by climate change. On Thursday, the DOJ sued New York and Vermont, challenging their climate superfund laws that would force fossil fuel companies to pay into state-based funds based on previous greenhouse gas emissions.\n\n\"These burdensome and ideologically motivated laws and lawsuits threaten American energy independence and our country's economic and national security,\" Attorney General Pamela Bondi said in a statement. \"The Department of Justice is working to 'Unleash American Energy' by stopping these illegitimate impediments to the production of affordable, reliable energy that Americans deserve.\"\n\nThe DOJ lawsuits, which legal experts say are unprecedented, mark the latest of the Trump administration's attacks on environmental work and raises concern over states' abilities to retain the power to take climate action without federal opposition.\n\nDOJ's court filings said the states' plans and policies \"impermissibly regulate out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions and obstruct the Clean Air Act's comprehensive federal-state framework and EPA's regulatory discretion.\"\n\nThe DOJ cited the Clean Air Act -- a federal law authorizing the Environmental Protection Agency to regulate air emissions -- saying it creates \"a program for regulating air pollution in the United States and \"displaces\" the ability of States to regulate greenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders.\"\n\nDOJ argued Wednesday that Hawaii and Michigan are violating the intent of the Act that enables the EPA authority to set nationwide standards for greenhouse gases, citing the states' expected litigation against oil and gas companies for alleged climate damage.\n\nDemocratic Michigan Attorney General Dana Nessel last year tapped private law firms to go after the fossil fuel industry for negatively affecting the state's climate and environment.\n\nMeanwhile, Democratic Hawaii Governor Josh Green plans to target fossil fuel companies that he said should take responsibility for their role in the state's climate impacts, including 2023's deadly Lahaina wildfire.\n\nWhen burned, fossil fuels release emissions such as carbon dioxide that warm the planet.\n\nA spokesperson for Democratic Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer's office deferred to Nessel when asked for comment.\n\n\"This lawsuit is at best frivolous and arguably sanctionable,\" Nessel said in a statement, which noted that Michigan hasn't filed a lawsuit. \"If the White House or Big Oil wish to challenge our claims, they can do so when our lawsuit is filed; they will not succeed in any attempt to preemptively bar our access to make our claims in the courts. I remain undeterred in my intention to file this lawsuit the President and his Big Oil donors so fear.\"\n\nGreen's office and the Hawaii Attorney General's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMeanwhile, Thursday's filings called the states' Superfund Acts -- modeled on the 45-year-old federal superfund law enacted to address the harm associated with hazardous waste sites -- \"a transparent monetary-extraction scheme.\" Trump has suggested the superfund laws \"extort\" payments from energy entities.\n\nNew York is looking for $75 billion and has been previously challenged by 22 states for the law; Vermont hasn't specified what it is seeking. Both laws were approved last year.\n\n\"By purporting to regulate the effect of greenhouse gas emissions on climate change, the Act necessarily reaches far beyond\" the states of New York and Vermont, the DOJ argued, saying the states are incorrectly looking to regulate nationwide and global airspace.\n\nThe offices of New York Gov. Kathy Hochul, Attorney General Letitia James, Vermont Gov. Phil Scott and Vermont Attorney General Charity Clark did not immediately return emailed requests for comment.\n\n\"At a time when States should be contributing to a national effort to secure reliable sources of domestic energy,\" all four states are choosing \"to stand in the way,\" all four filings said.\n\nIn its filings, the DOJ repeated the Republican president's claims of America's energy emergency and crisis.\n\nBut legal experts raised concern over the government's arguments.\n\nMichael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said usual procedure is the DOJ asking a court to intervene in pending environmental litigation -- as is the case in some instances across the country.\n\nWhile this week's suits are consistent with Trump's plans to oppose state actions that interfere with energy dominance, \"it's highly unusual,\" Gerrard told The Associated Press of the cases of Hawaii and Michigan. \"What we expected is they would intervene in the pending lawsuits, not to try to preempt or prevent a lawsuit from being filed. It's an aggressive move in support of the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\"It raises all kinds of eyebrows,\" he added. \"It's an intimidation tactic, and it's telling the fossil fuel companies how much Trump loves them.\"\n\nAnn Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has previously consulted on climate litigation, said this week's lawsuits look \"like DOJ grasping at straws,\" noting that EPA Administrator Lee Zeldin said his agency is seeking to overturn a finding under the Clean Air Act that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.\n\n\"So on the one hand the U.S. is saying Michigan, and other states, can't regulate greenhouse gases because the Clean Air Act does so and therefore preempts states from regulating,\" Carlson said. \"On the other hand the U.S. is trying to say that the Clean Air Act should not be used to regulate. The hypocrisy is pretty stunning.\"\n\nTrump's administration has aggressively targeted climate policy in the name of fossil fuel investment. Federal agencies have announced plans to bolster coal power, roll back landmark water and air regulations, block renewable energy sources and double down on oil and gas expansion.",

The inspectors general were from the Defense and State departments, as well as from the U.S. Agency for International Development, which was the government's main conduit for distributing foreign aid before the Trump administration largely dismantled it earlier this year.\n\nThe United States policy has been that repatriating residents of camps like al-Hol and its smaller neighbor, Roj, is the only way to keep ISIS from regaining strength in the Middle East. The presence of militants in the camps and the poor living conditions have made them fertile recruiting grounds. U.S. officials have also said repatriations are a necessary step toward relieving the United States of financial responsibility for the camps.\n\nBut major reductions in American aid have hobbled that effort, the report said. No Syrians left al-Hol to return to their homes in the first three months of the year because \"key project activities identifying, preparing, and receiving Syrian returnees were halted,\" according to the inspectors general report.\n\nIn addition, the report said pauses in security funding at al-Hol and Roj had led to periods of looting and protests, and a rise in attempts to smuggle people in and out of the camps. By the end of March, al-Hol housed about 36,000 people, most of them children, while Roj camp had another 2,400. They are not allowed to leave without permission.\n\nDuring the first quarter, about 1,500 families were transported from al-Hol and Roj to a camp just over the border in Iraq called Jeddah 1, which functions as a rehabilitation center for Iraqi returnees and is heavily financed by the United States, the report said. The Trump administration made an exception to the general freeze of foreign aid to provide money to the camp for clean water, health services and waste management.\n\nStill, by the end of the quarter, the Jeddah 1 center \"faced significant challenges in sustaining comprehensive humanitarian support\" because of the termination of U.S.-backed programs to help educate, employ, and integrate returnees into their home communities, the report said.\n\nThere were also shortfalls at Jeddah 1 in services for women and girls who had experienced violence, the inspectors general wrote. An uptick in begging was observed, caused by, among other things, the suspension of cash-for-work programs and delays in the delivery of food rations, the report said.\n\nIn addition, the termination of U.S. support for the World Health Organization has compromised efforts to ensure returnees sent to Jeddah 1 could get medicine, mental health services, and treatment for chronic conditions, the report said -- all of which had previously been considered important to helping people who had been affiliated with or under the influence of ISIS to return to normal life.\n\nThe White House, the Pentagon and the State Department did not immediately respond to a requests for comment about the report.\n\nAll told, Syria lost eight U.S.A.I.D. stabilization awards in the first quarter of the year, bringing its U.S.-backed portfolio of foreign aid projects down to just three. Iraq saw 20 U.S.A.I.D. stabilization awards cut, leaving it with just two.",

Lehfeldt's apparent refusal to cooperate comes after he allegedly made public statements online indicating he had intended to be present at the hearing.\n\n\"Under the Ted Stevens Act, an [National Governing Body] -- such as USFA -- is required to provide equal opportunities to athletes regardless of sex when engaged in developing interest and participation in the sport it governs throughout the United States,\" the letter accompanying the subpoena, signed by GOP House Oversight Chairman James Comer. \"The Subcommittee is concerned that the policies of USFA may not uphold these obligations and that the underlying law is not accomplishing its intended purpose. Therefore, the Subcommittee is investigating whether additional legislation regarding requirements of NGBs of amateur sports, like USFA, is necessary to address these issues.\"\n\nFEMALE FENCER DEFENDS PROTEST AGAINST TRANSGENDER OPPONENT\n\nLehfeldt and Andrews have both publicly expressed their support for allowing transgender women to compete on biological women's sports teams. House Republicans' decision to subpoena Lehfeldt follows an incident when a female fencer named Stephanie Turner was punished by USA Fencing for refusing to compete against a transgender competitor earlier this year.\n\nTurner, during a regional meet in March, refused to compete against a transgender competitor who previously had competed in the men's division. A video of her taking a symbolic knee at the start of the match, eventually earning her a \"black card,\" fencing's most severe penalty, went viral following the incident.\n\nENGLAND SPORTS GOVERNING BODY BANS TRANSGENDER ATHLETES FROM WOMEN'S SOCCER FOLLOWING UK COURT RULING\n\nCLICK HERE TO GET THE FOX NEWS APP\n\n\"In fencing, personally, I see it quite often,\" Turner said following the incident. \"I have witnessed transgender fencers in women's tournaments and girls' tournaments in different age categories, specifically Y-14 (the youngest age group).\"\n\nFox News Digital reached out to USA Fencing for comment but did not immediately receive a response.",

                "body": "Western Australia has a reputation for moving at a slower pace.\n\nOur capital city is known as a big country town, WA sometimes stands for Wait Awhile, and visiting comedians thank us for going to their \"late-night\" shows at 8.30pm.\n\nWe were the last colony to join the Australian federation in 1901. And on Saturday, we'll be the last to vote in the election.\n\nBut 2022 has become a stark reminder of why the audience shouldn't leave the stadium before Westralia runs its race.\n\nIn a tight sprint to the finish at the last federal election, it was WA's votes which pushed Anthony Albanese into the Lodge.\n\nYes, our time zone means the federal election could technically be over while we're still scrambling to the polling booths.\n\nBut if the race is close, sandgropers could once again be the kingmakers of this federal election.\n\nWA priorities clear\n\nThe campaign has been all about the cost of living, but there are a few issues specific to WA.\n\nOnce a political afterthought, the state has become a prime location for politicians racking up frequent-flyer points.\n\nAnthony Albanese has made a point of visiting WA more than 30 times during his prime ministership.\n\nPeter Dutton has accumulated less points, but has frequented the state more lately.\n\nBoth Labor and the Liberals have agreed to uphold WA's GST deal, which will cost the federal budget a measly $53 billion (and counting) over 10 years through to 2029-30. West Aussies can breathe a sigh of relief there.\n\nPeter Dutton has also promised to \"turbocharge\" jobs and investment in the mining and resources sector.\n\nThe seats on the line\n\nLet's take a look at where the federal priorities lie.\n\nWestern Australia is home to the country's only new electorate this election -- Bullwinkel.\n\nIt's a mish-mash of suburban and rural voters, spanning from the rural Wheatbelt to the city's fringe.\n\nThe diversity of issues in an electorate so wide-ranging makes it a difficult race to pick between Labor, Liberal, and the Nationals.\n\nWestern Australia is also home to the country's most marginal teal independent seat -- affluent, beachside Curtin.\n\nThe Liberal Party have deployed former international Uber executive Tom White to take on Climate 200-backed Kate Chaney.\n\nFormer dolphin trainer (and police officer) Sam Lim made a splash at the last federal election with a surprise win in the seat of Tangney.\n\nIt's Labor's most marginal seat in the state, previously held by the Liberals since 1984. Liberal candidate Howard Ong will be hoping to flip this key seat in Perth's south back to blue.\n\nIn the seat of Moore, incumbent Liberal-MP-turned-independent Ian Goodenough is threatening to up-end more than three decades of Liberal reign.\n\nMr Goodenough was ousted by his own party at preselection -- a move he said could've ignited a \"civil war\" at the time -- and will be taking on his replacement as Liberal candidate, former army officer Vince Connelly and Labor's Tom French.\n\nThe seat of Fremantle has been red for more than 90 years, held by Labor heavyweights including John Curtin and Kim Beazley Sr.\n\nLabor's Josh Wilson will be looking to maintain that record against an independent -- Kate Hulett -- who came just 424 votes off ousting Labor's state MP in the WA election two months ago.",

                "body": "As Albanese and Dutton crisscrossed the country aiming to win over voters, ABC photographers were there to capture the best images of the campaign.\n\nOver 35 days, politicians have donned hi-vis, sizzled sausages, shaken hands, and cuddled babies. All in the name of winning tomorrow's federal election.\n\nFor the party leaders, their media managers and the journalists accompanying them on the campaign trail, the days are long, the schedule is relentless, and the stakes are high. For the photographers, a large media scrum means muscling into the best position to take the winning image.\n\n\"[The crowd] makes it very, very difficult to navigate and to look for what we call gold -- a gold moment,\" ABC Chief Photographer Brendan Esposito says. Gold, according to the veteran photographer, is a moment of \"authenticity\" when \"the character of the person\" shines through.\n\nBut authentic moments can be hard to find. \"[The leaders] are all smooth, they're really guarded now, and they are polished in their performance, and everything is down to clockwork,\" Esposito says.\n\nEarly in the campaign, Peter Dutton visited the Assyrian New Year festivities at Fairfield in Western Sydney. \"He started to dance with a guy, and it was just a little jig,\" Esposito says. \"It wasn't anything fancy, but it was something that showed this guy, actually he does have humour. There is a lighter side to Peter.\"\n\nIt was a good moment because Peter doesn't give much away, Esposito says. \"My observations with him is that I think he's quite a shy man.\"\n\nLabor's Chris Bowen was at the same event and he and Dutton met unexpectedly. \"Bowen's face said it all. He was visibly uncomfortable,\" Esposito says.\n\nDespite careful choreography from media advisors and advancers, who arrive at a location ahead of time scouting for potential surprises and unwanted signs -- the iconic 2015 image of a beaming Tony Abbott snapped in front of giant yellow letters saying \"The Reject\" springs to mind -- on the campaign trail, sometimes the unexpected happens.\n\nThere was the moment the prime minister fell off a stage in Cessnock, in NSW, which became a Coalition attack point after Anthony Albanese initially said he hadn't fallen. Then there was the stray football Dutton kicked into the head of a camera operator.\n\n\"They like to have things heavily stage managed [but] it's exciting, you just never know what's going to happen,\" says ABC photographer Adam Kennedy, who is covering his sixth federal election.\n\n\"You don't get this access to the PM and the opposition leader out and about doing things throughout the normal political cycle. They'll go do a press conference here and there, but it's nothing like this.\"\n\nA photo can be powerful, it \"can turn an election\", ABC photographer Ian Cutmore believes.\n\nThis campaign, there have been a lot of protesters, he says. Early on a Rising Tide climate protester is shown shouting at Albanese, while on Tuesday, Dutton's plans went awry when anti-nuclear union protesters crashed a press conference in the marginal NSW seat of Gilmore - Dutton was whisked away by his minders and did not speak at the event.\n\n\"It does give you an idea of how fraught campaigning can be when these unexpected moments happen,\" ABC reporter Pablo Viñales said live on air at the time.\n\nThe role of the photographer on the campaign trail is to \"capture the event as well as capturing the person and who they are, to try to show the public what they're like,\" Cutmore says.\n\nFinding ways to illustrate what journalists are talking about can mean looking for the little things -- a gesture or an expression.\n\n\"Albo's got more facial expressions, but Dutton, he's got his head, which is a bit of a character you can just have a bit of fun with,\" Kennedy says.\n\nCutmore agrees. \"It's easier with Albanese because he's usually a bit more dynamic and expressive so he's always got interesting facial expressions and body language and hand gestures but Dutton is a lot harder,\" he says.\n\nThe obligatory photo ops of politicians with babies and children have been plentiful.\n\nFor Kennedy, this image of Albanese meeting three girls in outer Melbourne is his favourite. The girls lived next door to a family Albanese was meeting with, Kennedy says, and they simply ambushed the PM as he was leaving the event.\n\n\"There's a girl with her fingers intertwined like Monty Burns, watching. And then there's this tiny little girl staring up at the prime minister. She's got no fear.... The middle [girl] who's just sort of happy there in front of all these cameras.\"\n\nFor Cutmore, capturing Dutton having fun playing two-up at an RSL in Townsville on Anzac Day is one of his favourites. \"He was talking to all the people in the room. He was just a lot more relaxed and casual.\"\n\nIt can feel ridiculous when 30 members of the media are crowded into a cafe as a politician has a conversation with a family about the cost of living, Matt Roberts says. \"You take a step back and realise how silly and set up a lot of these things are but ...that's part of Australian political history, we've been doing this [campaign style] a long time and in a weird way it's sort of unique and charming.\"",

                "body": "Orland Mayorquin reported from Los Angeles, Robert Chiarito from Chicago, and Aishvarya Kavi from Washington.\n\nAnnual May Day rallies in cities across the country swelled with thousands of anti-Trump demonstrators on Thursday, as outcry continued to grow over the president's agenda and expansion of executive power.\n\nProtesters denounced the administration's effort to roll back workers' rights -- a particular sore spot on a day dedicated to celebrating organized labor -- as well as plans to cut education funding and carry out mass deportations.\n\n\"We're here to support our workers and our union,\" said Jena Olsen, 63, who has been a flight attendant for 39 years, at a large rally in Chicago's Union Park. But demonstrators said they were also angry about the \"threat to democracy\" posed by President Trump.\n\n\"I think the two coexist,\" Ms. Olsen said, \"and this huge turnout shows that.\"\n\nA separate effort, which organizers billed as a National Law Day of Action, brought legal professionals to the Supreme Court in Washington and federal courthouses across the country on Thursday to push for judicial independence and oppose efforts to intimidate law firms.\n\nThe lawyers demonstrating at the Supreme Court reaffirmed their oaths to serve with integrity and to protect the rule of law -- principles that do not appear to interest Mr. Trump, said Fabiola Gretzinger, 28. \"He thinks he's above it,\" she said.\n\nPolice closed streets for the crowds in major cities including New York, Los Angeles, Philadelphia and Washington. But protesters also rallied in small communities that voted overwhelmingly for President Trump, including places like Norman, Okla., Sauk City, Wis., and Hendersonville, N.C. Groups held signs in front of municipal buildings and public schools, and some demonstrators wore red to indicate support for public education.\n\nA rally in downtown Los Angeles began early on Thursday and focused largely on migrant rights. Jose Servín, 31, an organizer for a statewide coalition of advocacy groups who helped set up for the rally, held a sign that read, \"Come for one of us, come for all of us.\"\n\nMr. Servin immigrated to the United States as a child, he said. \"I found a place here where I can succeed, where I can thrive, where I can plant roots -- I'm a father now -- and I'm going to fight like hell to protect that,\" he said.\n\nThe protests -- more than 1,000 were expected across the country -- were spearheaded to coincide with traditional May Day labor rallies by 50501, a loose coalition of grass-roots activist groups, as well as by labor, nonprofit and civil rights organizations. May Day commemorates the struggle for an eight-hour workday, won by labor organizers in 1886 only after clashes in Chicago resulted in the deadly Haymarket Riot.\n\nLabor groups made up a significant portion of demonstrators at the rally in Chicago on Thursday, though pro-Palestinian activists and anti-Trump demonstrators swelled their ranks, and many saw their concerns as overlapping.\n\n\"He's tearing apart our Constitution,\" said Bill Hincks, 40, a union official from the Chicago suburb of Oak Forest, who faulted Mr. Trump for firing officials at agencies that regulate workplace safety, including at the National Labor Relations Board.\n\nThe Trump administration has sought to quell dissent in corporate America, universities, government agencies and the news media. But in recent weeks, demonstrations opposing the president's agenda, as well as resistance from some of the institutions targeted by Mr. Trump, have increased in size and frequency.\n\nGov. JB Pritzker of Illinois, a Democrat who first ran for office in 2018 because of his revulsion to Mr. Trump's first term, called for an even larger outcry during a speech on Sunday in New Hampshire.\n\n\"It's time to fight everywhere, and all at once,\" he said.\n\nKatie Benner contributed from Washington.",

                "title": "Fernandes at the double as Manchester United cruise against 10-man Athletic Bilbao",
                "body": "Manchester United enjoyed their night in Bilbao so much that they will surely be coming back. They remain the only unbeaten team among the more than 100 that have played in the Europa League over eight long months, and even if they do fall to a first defeat in seven days' time, they should be there on its final game in this same stadium, this season given meaning and potentially a triumphant end.\n\nThey came to the stadium everyone calls the Cathedral and defeated Athletic Club so convincingly that the second leg carries little threat. No one had won here this year in this competition and Athletic had conceded just 10 times in all competitions; United scored three in a quarter of an hour.\n\nAn opening goal from Casmeiro and two from Bruno Frenandes, the first of those from the spot and accompanied by a red card for Dani Viviain, destroyed the dreams of the faithful here and virtually ensured that they will return on 21 May against Spurs or Bodø/Glimt.\n\nUltimately this was an efficient, impressive performance in which United looked something like the team, and club, they are supposed to be: one that can win a European title that has become their salvation and a glimpse, perhaps of future hope, not least as it would give them Champions League access. One that ended up looking on a different level to their opponents.\n\nAthletic had started strongly too, forcing the first corner and the first roar inside 90 seconds. While United sought to slow the game down, the home side wanted to accelerate it. United's possession was not so much a platform for them to do something as for Athletic to, ready to asphyxiate their opponents, rob and then go at them. That front-footed approach, though, did open them to the ball behind and just four minutes in, Manuel Ugarte slipped into the right channel and released Alejandro Garncho scored what he thought was the opener. That was offside, but it was also a warning, an invitation to United to seek the same wing.\n\nIt would work too and repeatedly. André Onana had to save from Alex Berenguer, Iñaki Williams headed just over and when he then raced up the right and pulled back, Victor Lindelof twice had to make decisive interventions. The second of those, made almost on the line with Berenguer shooting from five yards out, really should have been the opener. Instead, having resisted the pressure, the red and white shirts coming at them, it was United that would get it just before the half hour.\n\nIt was made by United's unlikely hero doing unlikely things. More unlikely even than last time, although the moment was not as dramatic. Harry Maguire, the emergency striker who had completed the most astonishing comeback against Lyon, smacking in a header on 121 minutes to send Old Trafford wild, now went all Stanley Matthews to momentarily silence San Mamés. If that had been latter-day Ronaldo, this was more like his teenage incarnation.\n\nFaced by Mikel Jauregizar, Maguire went up the right, stopped, turned one way and the next, then started up again, going past the midfielder and delivering the cross. Manuel Ugarte headed it on and, at the far post, Casemiro arrived to nod into the net. United had a lead that was swiftly doubled, and in a way that gave them even more of an advantage than the goal they scored, two minutes enough to virtually terminate the tie.\n\nAgain, it started on the right, where United had always identified opportunity. When the ball from Noussair Mazraoui came across the six-yard box, Rasmus Højlund went down. Dani Vivian went straight to him and accused him of diving but the defender was protesting too much and if he had got away with it the first time ultimately he would pay for what he had done; Højlund may have been quick to go to ground but there had been a clear hand on his shoulder and when the referee Espen Eskås came back from the VAR screen where he was shown what he had not seen live, he pointed to the spot and pulled out a red card.\n\nVivian departed, Fernandes rolled in the penalty and this, it seemed, was done. Iñaki Williams did bend a shot wide but Athletic appeared gone and United added a third. Højlund scrambled for the ball, Ugarte provided the clever flick and Fernandes ran through to finish high into the net. The lead might even have extended still further before half-time, when Mazraoui smashed one off the bar.\n\nThe protests and the feeling of injustice which accompanied them off at the break increased early in the second when the referee was called to the screen to have another look at the moment when Maguire pulled down Maroan Sannadi. He decided that was no red card, any tiny hope that the numbers might be evened out, and a comeback would start, snuffed out. Instead, United controlled this, never in any danger. They managed it with a certain comfort, a sense of clear superiority, and the threat - if not an actual need - of extending the lead still further. There was another penalty appeal from Højlund, this time tangling with Yuri Berchiche. Ugarte and Casemiro both took aim from distance and the Brazilian put a header against the post.\n\nWilliams went sprinting up the pitch soon after, but Athletic were exhausted now, defeated, and those chances were a reminder that this could still get worse. For Manchester United, it could hardly get any better, and they will surely be back.",

                "title": "Geoengineers plot to poison the skies: Boeing 777s may soon dump toxic sulfur, risking acid rain catastrophe   - NaturalNews.com",
                "body": "Global elites are fast-tracking geoengineering under the guise of \"climate intervention,\" bypassing public scrutiny.\n\nIn a brazen move that defies both science and sanity, geoengineers are now pushing to weaponize commercial airliners in a radical experiment to alter Earth's climate. A new study published in Earth's Future reveals plans to retrofit Boeing 777 jets to dump millions of tons of sulfur dioxide into the lower stratosphere -- a scheme that could trigger catastrophic acid rain, poison ecosystems, and accelerate the very environmental collapse it claims to prevent.\n\nThe study, authored by researchers from University College London and Yale, admits the plan would \"strongly increase side-effects such as acid rain\" due to the sheer volume of sulfur required. Unlike high-altitude aerosol injection (SAI), which requires specialized aircraft, this shortcut relies on existing jets flying at just 42,000 feet -- ensuring the toxic particles rain down faster and in greater concentrations.\n\nThe irony is staggering: To \"save\" the planet from climate change, they're willing to flood it with poison.\n\nThe study's authors openly concede that their low-altitude sulfur-dumping strategy is \"sub-optimal\" -- meaning it's less effective, more dangerous, and disproportionately harms polar regions. Yet they advocate for it anyway, citing \"lower technical barriers\" and the ability to deploy faster.\n\nThis isn't science. It's a corporate-military power grab disguised as environmentalism.\n\nThe push for geoengineering is nothing new. For decades, global elites have weaponized weather under the guise of \"environmental stewardship.\" In the 20th century, cloud seeding was used to manipulate rainfall. Now, they've escalated to stratospheric aerosol injection -- a far more dangerous game.\n\nThe study compares the sulfur output to the 1991 Mount Pinatubo eruption, which temporarily cooled the planet but also triggered widespread acid rain and ozone depletion. Yet, unlike a natural disaster, this would be a permanent, man-made atmospheric regime -- one that, once started, cannot be stopped without triggering \"termination shock\" -- a sudden, catastrophic warming spike.\n\nThe geoengineering-industrial complex is already lining up for taxpayer-funded contracts. Britain's Aria agency is preparing field experiments, while defense contractors and aerospace giants like Boeing could cash in on retrofitting fleets.\n\nMeanwhile, the public is kept in the dark. No democratic debate. No informed consent. Just a silent coup against the sky itself.\n\nThis isn't about saving the planet. It's about control -- engineering dependence on a toxic, irreversible atmospheric intervention. The same corporate and governmental forces that wrecked the environment with industrialization now seek to \"fix\" it by dousing the skies in sulfur.\n\nAs the study admits, this plan is flawed, dangerous, and inefficient -- yet it's being fast-tracked anyway. The question isn't whether they can do it. The question is: Will we let them, or will government enforce new state laws combating geoengineering?",

                "body": "Geopolitical Risks: China has weaponized rare earth exports in past trade disputes; rising U.S.-China tensions could disrupt supply chains, crippling AI, drones, and renewable energy sectors.\n\nA new investigative report has exposed a looming crisis for the United States' ambitions in artificial intelligence (AI) and robotics: China's near-total control over rare earth minerals essential for manufacturing advanced technology. With the U.S. heavily reliant on Chinese exports, experts warn that America's ability to scale up AI-driven robotics -- critical for military, medical, and industrial applications -- is at serious risk.\n\nAt the heart of the issue is neodymium, a rare earth element vital for producing high-performance magnets used in actuators -- the components that enable robotic movement. Without neodymium, the production of advanced robots grinds to a halt.\n\n\"If you don't have neodymium, you can't make actuators. And if you can't make actuators, you can't make robots,\" warns Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, in a recent analysis. \"Guess who controls the world's neodymium output? China, with a near-monopoly.\"\n\nChina currently dominates over 90% of global rare earth production, including dysprosium and praseodymium, which are also crucial for heat-resistant magnets in robotics and electric vehicles. The U.S., meanwhile, has fallen dangerously behind in domestic extraction and refining capabilities.\n\nRecognizing the vulnerability, the Trump administration recently signed a mineral extraction deal with Ukraine, part of a broader strategy to secure alternative sources of rare earths. Similar negotiations are reportedly underway with African nations.\n\n\"Whoever makes the best robots -- and the most robots -- will dominate wars, economic competition, aerospace, and medicine,\" Adams notes. However, analysts caution that these efforts may be too little, too late. Even with new mining agreements, China's refining infrastructure and supply chain dominance mean breaking free from dependence will take years -- if it's possible at all.\n\nThe stakes extend far beyond robotics. AI development, military drones, medical devices, and even renewable energy technologies like wind turbines rely on these minerals. A supply disruption could cripple multiple industries, leaving the U.S. scrambling for alternatives.\n\nMeanwhile, China has shown a willingness to weaponize its rare earth dominance. In past trade disputes, it has restricted exports to pressure other nations. With tensions rising between Washington and Beijing, the risk of such tactics being used again is high.\n\nThe U.S. must accelerate domestic mining and processing capabilities while forging alliances with mineral-rich nations. But time is running short. As Adams puts it: \"The race for robot supremacy is really a race for rare earth control -- and right now, China is winning.\"\n\nFor now, America's AI and robotics future hinges on a precarious supply chain -- one controlled by its greatest geopolitical rival.\n\nWatch the May 1 episode of \"Brighteon Broadcast News\" as Mike Adams, the Health Ranger, talks about minerals deals, elemental crisis, Walmart, China and robots...it's all connected.\n\nELEMENTAL CRISIS: How China and Russia Control the Critical Minerals Needed for AI, Military Robots, and Economic Domination\n\nTrump's critical Ukraine minerals deal nears completion",

                "body": "The suits, which legal experts say are unprecedented, mark the latest of the Trump administration's attacks on environmental work and raise concern over states' abilities to retain the power to take climate action without federal opposition.\n\nIn court filings, the justice department said the Clean Air Act - a federal law authorizing the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to regulate air emissions - \"creates a comprehensive program for regulating air pollution in the United States and 'displaces' the ability of states to regulate greenhouse gas emissions beyond their borders\".\n\nThe justice department argues that Hawaii and Michigan are violating the intent of the act that enables the EPA authority to set nationwide standards for greenhouse gases, citing the states' pending litigation against oil and gas companies for alleged climate damage.\n\nMichigan's attorney general, Dana Nessel, a Democrat, last year tapped private law firms to go after the fossil fuel industry for negatively affecting the state's climate and environment.\n\nMeanwhile, Hawaii's governor, Josh Green, another Democrat, plans to target fossil fuel companies that he said should take responsibility for their role in the state's climate consequences, including 2023's deadly Lahaina wildfire.\n\nWhen burned, fossil fuels release emissions such as carbon dioxide that warm the planet.\n\nBoth states' laws \"impermissibly regulate out-of-state greenhouse gas emissions and obstruct the Clean Air Act's comprehensive federal-state framework and EPA's regulatory discretion\", the justice department's court filings said.\n\nThe justice department also repeated the Republican president's claims of America's energy emergency and crisis. \"At a time when states should be contributing to a national effort to secure reliable sources of domestic energy\", Hawaii and Michigan are \"choosing to stand in the way\", the filings said.\n\nA spokesperson for the office of the Democratic Michigan governor, Gretchen Whitmer, deferred to Nessel when asked for comment.\n\n\"This lawsuit is at best frivolous and arguably sanctionable,\" Nessel said in a statement, which noted that Michigan hasn't filed a lawsuit. \"If the White House or big oil wish to challenge our claims, they can do so when our lawsuit is filed; they will not succeed in any attempt to preemptively bar our access to make our claims in the courts. I remain undeterred in my intention to file this lawsuit the president and his big oil donors so fear.\"\n\nGreen's office and the Hawaii attorney general's office did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nBut legal experts raised concern over the government's arguments.\n\nMichael Gerrard, founder and faculty director of the Columbia University Sabin Center for Climate Change Law, said usual procedure is for the justice department to ask for a court to intervene in pending environmental litigation - as is the case in some instances across the country.\n\nWhile this week's suits are consistent with Trump's plans to oppose state actions that interfere with energy dominance, \"it's highly unusual\", Gerrard told the Associated Press. \"What we expected is they would intervene in the pending lawsuits, not to try to preempt or prevent a lawsuit from being filed. It's an aggressive move in support of the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\"It raises all kinds of eyebrows,\" he added. \"It's an intimidation tactic, and it's telling the fossil fuel companies how much Trump loves them.\"\n\nAnn Carlson, an environmental law professor at the University of California, Los Angeles, who has previously consulted on climate litigation, said this week's lawsuits look \"like DoJ grasping at straws\", noting that the EPA administrator, Lee Zeldin, said his agency is seeking to overturn a finding under the Clean Air Act that greenhouse gases endanger public health and welfare.\n\n\"So on the one hand the US is saying Michigan, and other states, can't regulate greenhouse gases because the Clean Air Act does so and therefore preempts states from regulating,\" Carlson said. \"On the other hand the US is trying to say that the Clean Air Act should not be used to regulate. The hypocrisy is pretty stunning.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has aggressively targeted climate policy in the name of fossil fuel investment. Federal agencies have announced plans to bolster coal power, roll back landmark water and air regulations, block renewable energy sources, and double down on oil and gas expansion.",

                "title": "Have The Intermittent Energy Blackouts Begun?",
                "body": "Today there have been widespread electricity blackouts across Europe, beginning in Spain and Portugal in the early afternoon (local time), and then spreading to other countries including France, Andorra, Belgium and the Netherlands. Is this related to the increasing penetration of intermittent generation from wind and solar facilities?\n\nFor years, many in the climate skeptic community have warned that expansion of intermittent renewable electricity generation on the grid will, sooner or later, lead to frequent blackouts. The reason for the warning is easy to understand: The grid has some rather exacting operational requirements that the intermittent renewable generation technologies cannot fulfill. Primary among these requirements are, first, minute-by-minute matching of electricity supply with electricity demand and, second, grid-wide synchronization of the frequency of the alternating current. When wind and solar provided relatively small portions of the electricity consumed, other generation sources, particularly thermal (fossil fuel) and hydro, would fulfill these requirements. But as wind and solar come to dominate generation, the problems become much more difficult to solve.\n\nHere at Manhattan Contrarian, I have mostly steered clear of covering this topic. Although I think I understand the main issues, I am certainly not a grid engineer. And there are many smart people who are engineers and who have the job of \"balancing\" the grid to keep it consistently up and running in the face of the challenges of intermittent wind and solar generation. Maybe they can succeed. I doubt it. But I definitely have wanted to avoid \"crying wolf,\" predicting over and over that frequent blackouts are imminent, only to find that the engineers have come up with solutions that seem to work reasonably well.\n\nAs of this writing, it does not appear that a definitive cause (or causes) of today's blackouts has been established. However, there is every reason to think that the increasing penetration of wind and solar generation in Spain is the most important part of the problem. Here are links to some articles that have appeared so far today: this one from the Daily Mail at 8:41 AM EDT (which would be 2:41 PM in Spain); this one from Yahoo News at 10:21 AM EDT (4:21 PM in Spain); and this one from Climate Change Dispatch (no time indicated, but based on a paywalled piece from the Telegraph, with a time stamp of 3:21 BST).\n\nAccording to the piece in the Daily Mail, Spain's state electricity network operator, known as Red Electric, reported that today's problem began with \"'a very strong oscillation' in the electrical network [that] caused Spain's power system to 'disconnect from the European system.'\" On the question of the initial cause of the \"oscillation,\" there is only speculation. Proposed causes range from \"extreme temperature variations along very high-voltage power lines in Spain,\" to a hacking attack.\n\nBut whatever the initial cause of the \"oscillation,\" what is clear is that the Spanish system then lacked the ability to respond sufficiently to keep the power on. Why? The Daily Mail puts forth a very plausible explanation of grid instability resulting from heavy reliance on wind and solar generation. The Mail attributes the theory to \"some analysts\" (unnamed):\n\n[S]ome analysts have suggested that the Spanish grid operator's reliance on renewable energy sources to supply the majority of the nation's electricity could have led to the blackout. Traditional generators, like coal and hydroelectric plants or gas turbines, are connected directly to the grid via heavy spinning machines. When turned on, these massive machines are in constant motion and the inertia created by their weight and momentum acts like a shock absorber, helping to insulate the grid against a sudden disturbance - for example, in the event of a transmission failure. Solar and wind power do not provide the natural inertia generated by these so-called 'spinning machines', leaving the grid more vulnerable to disruptions and subsequent oscillations in the electrical frequency.\n\nJust before the blackout hit, it seems that solar facilities were generating over 60% of Spain's electricity:\n\nAt 12:30pm local time today - five minutes before the widespread blackouts occurred - solar power was generating some 60% of Spain's electricity. . . .\n\nBut how about wind generation? This is from the Yahoo News piece:\n\nSpain has one of Europe's highest proportions of renewable energy, providing about 56pc of the nation's electricity. More than half of its renewables comes from wind with the rest from solar and other sources. That means Spain's electricity supplies are increasingly reliant on the weather delivering enough wind to balance its grid. For much of the last 24 hours, that wind has been largely missing. The website Windy.com, for example, shows wind speeds of 2-3mph, leaving the country reliant on solar energy and old gas-fired power stations.\n\nSo when the \"oscillation\" occurred, what is going to keep the grid steady on its 50 Hz frequency? From Michael Schellenberger today on X:\n\n[A]ll of Europe appears to have been seconds away a continent-wide blackout. The grid frequency across continental Europe plunged to 49.85 hertz -- just a hair above the red-line collapse threshold. The normal operating frequency for Europe's power grid is 50.00 Hz, kept with an extremely tight margin of ±0.1 Hz. Anything outside ±0.2 Hz triggers major emergency actions. If the frequency had fallen just another 0.3 Hz -- below 49.5 Hz -- Europe could have suffered a system-wide cascading blackout.\n\nThe bottom line is that there were multi-hour blackouts in many places today. A random \"oscillation\" of some sort, which could have been easily handled in a world of fossil fuel power plants, became a huge problem when wind and solar generators could not respond to it appropriately. And so people were stuck for hours in elevators or subway trains; traffic lights went dark; banking and cell phone networks stopped working; and so forth. But within a few hours all of those were back in business.\n\nSo was this really a big deal? As Schellenberger points out, with just \"a hair\" more frequency variation it could have been far worse. Will that happen some time soon? I'm not going to pretend I know. But I do know that the electricity system in most of Europe and many U.S. states is in the hands of crazed fanatics who have no idea what they are doing. My own bet would be that there are many far worse blackouts to come, until this idiotic \"net zero\" thing is abandoned.",

                "body": "China has not taken over a disputed islet near a key Philippines island despite a provocative Chinese coast guard operation last month to plant a flag on the reef, the State Department said.\n\nChinese state media announced recently that its coast guard in mid-April carried out a \"maritime control\" activity over what Beijing calls Tiexian Reef and the Philippines calls Sandy Cay.\n\nReports showed a group of camouflaged Chinese troops holding a flag there in a bid to assert sovereignty over the small islet in the Spratly Islands.\n\nDays after the photo of the Chinese flag was published, troops from the Philippine coast guard, navy and police landed on the 180-square-yard reef and were photographed holding a Philippines flag on April 25.\n\nOn Tuesday, Chinese warships were dispatched to the area amid official charges by Beijing that the Philippines is engaged in \"disturbances.\"\n\nThe Philippines military said in a statement, also on Tuesday, that U.S. and Philippines air forces carried out a joint patrol over the South China Sea to highlight joint defense cooperation. The air patrol included three Philippines FA-50 fighter jets, two U.S. B-1B bombers, two F-16s and an F-18.\n\nA State Department official denied the islet was overrun by China.\n\n\"China's provocative flag unfurling is detrimental to preserving peace and stability in the region and is the latest example of its repeated escalatory and irresponsible actions in the South China Sea,\" the official told The Washington Times.\n\n\"Contrary to media reports, China has not 'seized' Sandy Cay and the feature remains unoccupied,\" the official said.\n\nWashington remains in close communications with Philippines officials regarding the attempt to assert Chinese sovereignty, the official said.\n\nThe dual flag-planting and claims over the reef are the latest round in mounting tensions between Beijing and Manila in the South China Sea.\n\nSandy Cay is less than three miles from the Philippines island of Pagasa that hosts military forces and a civilian population.\n\nPegasa, also called Thitu Island, is the location of a Japanese-built radar system and is used for training by the Philippine navy's special warfare group.\n\nThe island also has a coast guard base that was set up in 2023 to counter what Manila called Chinese aggression in the region.\n\nChina claims 90% of the South China Sea, including the Spratlys, which are near the main Philippines island of Luzon.\n\nChina's South China Sea sovereignty claim was struck down as illegal by an international arbitral tribunal in 2016, although China rejected the ruling and has continued provocative actions in a bid to assert control over the South China Sea.\n\nThe sea is a major strategic waterway that sees between an estimated $3.5 trillion and $5 trillion annually in trade.\n\nChina's military has seized a number of disputed islands since 2012 and built military bases on several that are now armed with anti-ship and anti-aircraft missiles.\n\nChina and the Philippines recently have engaged in a series of low-level confrontations in the region involving the ramming of vessels, the firing of water cannon by Chinese ships and, in at least two cases, China's use of lasers against Philippines aircraft and vessels.\n\nThe State Department has declared several times in recent years that any Chinese attack on the Philippines over disputed islands could trigger the U.S.-Philippines mutual defense treaty.\n\nHowever, Navy forces have taken no action to intervene in the sea confrontations.\n\nChina's state CCTV broadcaster said the landing on Sandy Cay was designed to \"exercise sovereignty and jurisdiction,\" to carry out an \"inspection,\" and \"collect video evidence regarding the illegal activities of the Philippine side.\"\n\nThe People's Liberation Army said Tuesday that the southern theater command dispatched warships in the South China Sea on routine patrols.\n\n\"Recently, the Philippines has been frequently carrying out maritime infringement provocations, creating disturbances and pulling in countries from outside the region to organize so-called 'joint patrols,'\" it said.\n\n\"Troops in the theater of operations are maintaining a high level of alert, resolutely defending the country's territorial sovereignty and maritime rights and interests, and resolutely safeguarding peace and stability in the South China Sea region.\"\n\nThe Chinese sovereignty claim over Sandy Cay has raised concerns among U.S. and Philippines officials that the operation there will signal a new expansion of the Chinese military's island reclamation project.\n\nIn 2012, China took over Scarborough Shoal in the Spratlys and the Obama administration took no action against the takeover.\n\nThe lack of a response set in motion a major Chinese island-building campaign that resulted in new PLA bases on several reefs, including Fiery Cross Reef, Mischief Reef and Subi Reef.\n\nRetired Navy Capt. Jim Fanell, a former Pacific Fleet intelligence director, said the latest attempted island grab by China is \"another step in the continuation of the [Chinese President] Xi Jinping and the Chinese Communist Party's Great Rejuvenation strategy to 'restore' territory they falsely assert is theirs.\"\n\n\"The world has witnessed, since 2012 at Scarborough Shoal, the People's Republic of China take physical possession and control of the vast majority of the South China Sea,\" he said in an email.\n\nCapt. Fanell said more than a decade of \"doing nothing\" against the Chinese maritime sovereignty campaign demonstrates that U.S. resolve has eroded and that American national security and naval forces in the Pacific are at great risk, as well as those of U.S. allies.\n\nHe urged the Trump administration to counter the Chinese maritime aggression by dispatching Navy warships to the sea. \"It is long past time to dispatch the Seventh Fleet to these waters to prevent or disrupt any PRC effort to seize another inch of territory from our treaty ally,\" he said.\n\n\"This is not a call to war, but a call to stand up and push back.\"\n\nCarl O. Schuster, also a retired Navy captain, said the photo op on Sandy Cay appears to be a variant of China's 1990s tactic of planting \"border\" markers on uninhabited atolls, islets and cays.\n\nThe objective is to create false evidence used to back the Beijing narrative of ownership over the South China Sea.\n\nPhilippines authorities landing on the Cay and photographing their flag seek to counter the Chinese operation.\n\n\"This incident was a test to determine how Manila and Washington would react,\" Capt. Schuster said.\n\n\"Had the Philippines done nothing but protest, the PRC would have initiated the next step -- construction of a 'fishing shelter' for its fishing community operating in the area,\" he said. \"However, Manila's response has interrupted China's narratives and immediate plans.\"\n\nThe current standoff in the South China Sea comes as U.S. military forces are engaged in a major annual exercise with the Philippines known as Balikatan.\n\nThe exercises have included the deployment of long-range U.S. land-attack missiles and a new remotely controlled anti-ship missile system.\n\nThe exercises and the missile deployments were denounced by China as destabilizing.",

                "title": "IMF and World Bank: Crony Covid Crackdown Enablers",
                "body": "What should the US government expect when Congress and endless presidents give the World Bank and IMF billions of US tax dollars to play with? The US government is on the hook for $52 billion to the World Bank. The US has a financial commitment of $183 billion to the IMF.\n\nTreasury Secretary Scott Bessent complained last week that the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund are suffering from \"mission creep.\" But Bessent announced that Trump will be \"doubling down\" on supporting the largest foreign aid gushers on earth. \"Far from stepping back, 'America First' seeks to expand U.S. leadership in international institutions like the I.M.F. and World Bank,\" Bessent declared.\n\nBessent complained that the IMF \"devotes disproportionate time and resources to work on climate change, gender, and social issues.\" Unfortunately, Bessent said nothing about how the IMF and World Bank bankrolled many of the worst crony Covid crackdown policies.\n\nBut what should the US government expect when Congress and endless presidents give the World Bank and IMF billions of US tax dollars to play with? The US government is on the hook for $52 billion to the World Bank. The US has a financial commitment of $183 billion to the IMF.\n\nThe IMF was created in 1944 to shore up currencies and help nations with temporary balance-of-payment problems. In the decades since the IMF's founding, global capital markets and fluctuating currency exchange rates have made the IMF a relic. But too many people have gotten rich from IMF largesse to permit the curtain to be closed on this institution.\n\nThe IMF enabled scores of governments that chose to pointlessly shut down their own economies after the outbreak of Covid-19. IMF Managing Director Kristalina Georgieva declared in April 2021, \"While the recovery [from Covid] is underway, too many countries are falling behind and economic inequality is worsening. Strong policy action is needed to give everyone a fair shot -- a shot in the arm to end the pandemic everywhere, and a shot at a better future for vulnerable people and countries.\"\n\nThe IMF's \"fair shot\" consisted of its international bureaucrats providing scores of billions of dollars in \"emergency financing\" to 80 governments, most of whom exploited Covid to stretch their own power. The IMF provided emergency relief via the Catastrophe Containment and Relief Trust (CCRT) to 29 governments to supposedly help them \"combat the impact of the COVID-19 pandemic.\" The IMF's deluge of handouts to government helped fuel the worldwide inflation surge in recent years.\n\nThe World Bank President Ajay Banga \"has sought to emphasize the bank's focus on job creation...and to prioritize private sector involvement in projects around the world,\" the New York Times reported. But the World Bank's notion of the private sector has often been either a fraud or a political smokescreen. In the late 1980s, the World Bank touted its loans to Communist nations as private sector-oriented loans - one bait-and-switch too many, as I detailed in a 1988 Wall Street Journal article. And permitting the Bank to exonerate its handouts by counting illusory jobs created is a recipe for make-work scams.\n\nThe Covid pandemic provided the World Bank with the chance to play savior. In the first months of the pandemic, the Bank proudly announced that its \"emergency operations to fight COVID-19 (coronavirus) have reached 100 developing countries - home to 70% of the world's population.\" From April 2020 to March 2021, the World Bank \"committed over $200 billion, an unprecedented level of financial support, to public and private sector clients to fight the impacts of the pandemic. Our support is tailored to the health, economic, and social shocks that countries are facing.\" The fact that the World Bank was effectively financing governments to pointlessly shock their own nations was omitted from celebratory press releases.\n\nThe IMF and World Bank have helped turn many foreign nations into kleptocracies - governments of thieves. A 2002 American Economic Review analysis concluded that \"increases in [foreign] aid are associated with contemporaneous increases in corruption,\" and that \"corruption is positively correlated with aid received from the United States.\"\n\nMost importantly, neither the IMF nor the World Bank has any qualms about bankrolling tyranny. A 2015 report of the United Nations' Special Rapporteur on extreme poverty and human rights, Philip Alston, concluded that the World Bank \"now stands almost alone, along with the International Monetary Fund, in insisting that human rights are matters of politics which it must, as a matter of legal principle, avoid, rather than being an integral part of the international legal order.\"\n\nThe Bank justifies this position by insisting that it cannot involve \"itself in the partisan politics or ideological disputes that affect its member countries\" by improper methods such as \"favoring political factions, parties or candidates in elections,\" or \"endorsing or mandating a particular form of government, political bloc or political ideology.\"\n\nBut any time an international organization financially bails out a regime, it bolsters its power. After the United States invaded Afghanistan and Iraq, the Pentagon coined a term that perfectly captures the effect of foreign aid: \"Money as a Weapon System.\" The 2015 UN report noted that \"the existing approach taken by the World Bank to human rights is incoherent, counterproductive and unsustainable. For most purposes, the World Bank is a human rights-free zone. In its operational policies, in particular, it treats human rights more like an infectious disease than universal values and obligations.\"\n\nThe World Bank actively blindfolds itself to avoid hearing about atrocities in nations ruled by governments that it is bankrolling. The Special Rapporteur noted, \"By refusing to take account of any information emanating from human rights sources, the Bank places itself in an artificial bubble.\"\n\nThe Trump administration's lust for \"doubling down\" on the IMF and World Bank is dicey to reconcile with their terminating 90% of foreign aid contracts from the US Agency for International Development (USAID). Cynics across the land rejoiced that Washington policymakers finally recognized one of the biggest swindles of the past 80 years.\n\nIf the Trump team can't even get sound policy on the World Bank, then what hope is there of them resolving any more complex challenges? I was briefly a consultant for the World Bank in the late 1980s, getting paid to co-author a report on the follies of farm subsidies. At that point, Reagan administration officials had periodically caterwauled about the Bank for almost a decade, and they were followed by sporadic howling by the US Treasury Department ever since. Secretary Bessent complained on Wednesday that the World Bank \"should no longer expect blank checks for vapid, buzzword-centric marketing accompanied by halfhearted commitments to reform.\" But after almost a half-century of failed US attempts to reform the Bank and IMF, there is no reason to expect any boondoggles to be left behind.\n\nOr do Trump's appointees believe that laundering U.S. tax dollars through international entities somehow makes them beneficent? Or maybe US Treasury Department honchos want to make sure they continue to get invited to the most lavish parties in D.C. and around the world. Regardless, the IMF and World Bank financing the worst Covid policies around the globe is another reminder of why those entities should be axed.",

                "body": "Martin Scorsese will produce a new documentary featuring an on-camera interview with Pope Francis that was recorded at Vatican City in December, a few months before the pope died at the age of 88.\n\nThe film, \"Aldeas -- A New Story,\" is about the worldwide cultural project developed by Scholas Occurrentes, a global educational movement founded by Francis in 2013, the same year he was elected pope. Communities around the world will create scripts for short films that highlight their identities, histories and values.\n\nSnippets of the conversation between the pope and Scorsese will be interwoven into the film, which does not have a release date.\n\nIn a statement on Wednesday, Scorsese said it was important to Francis for \"people across the globe to exchange ideas with respect while also preserving their cultural identity, and cinema is the best medium to do that.\" Before the pope's death, Francis called \"Aldeas\" a poetic project because it \"goes to the roots of what human life is.\"\n\nThe project punctuates a long relationship between the pope and Scorsese, whose work has sometimes been religious in nature. When \"The Last Temptation of Christ\" was released in 1988, it drew protests and outrage from religious groups.\n\nIn 2016, Scorsese met with Francis to discuss his movie \"Silence,\" a drama about a Portuguese Jesuit priest who heads to 17th-century Japan, where Christians are persecuted. They met again in 2023, when Scorsese announced he would make another film about Jesus. The director's most recent project, \"Martin Scorsese Presents: The Saints,\" dramatizes the lives of eight Catholic saints.\n\nWhen Francis died, Scorsese said in a statement to Variety that he was lucky to have known him and that his loss for the world was immense.\n\n\"He had an ironclad commitment to the good,\" Scorsese said. \"He knew in his soul that ignorance was a terrible plague on humanity. So he never stopped learning. And he never stopped enlightening.\"",

                "body": "The National Law Day of Action, which drew roughly 1,500 people in New York City, was organized to resist the president's threats against judges and the nation's jurisprudence.\n\nThe crowd of protesters that packed Foley Square in downtown Manhattan on Thursday was as raucous as any demonstration in a politically vociferous city. It was, however, decidedly more wonky and dapper.\n\nAbout 1,500 demonstrators, many of them lawyers sporting business attire, jammed the plaza outside Manhattan's federal courthouse as part of the National Law Day of Action, chanting in favor of the rule of law and hoisting pocket Constitutions to the sky.\n\nIt was one of around 50 similar actions around the nation on Thursday, led by lawyers who say President Trump is threatening the foundation of America's legal system.\n\n\"The rule of law protects us all. Without it we will surely fall,\" the crowd chanted.\n\nIn his second term, Mr. Trump has aimed to hobble elite law firms, threatened to impeach judges and ignored their orders. For many inside the legal profession, his actions have presented an unpalatable choice between compromising their values by staying silent and facing professional risk by speaking out.\n\nNow, a growing number of lawyers see a moral imperative in choosing the latter option. They believe Mr. Trump's crusade is threatening not just their livelihoods, but a system to which they have devoted their lives. On Thursday, thousands of lawyers were expected to protest at federal courthouses in New York, Chicago and San Francisco -- roughly 50 cities in all.\n\nIn interviews, attendees of the event in New York pointed to a range of actions, including Mr. Trump's targeting of law firms he viewed as hostile, wrongful deportations and the arrest of a Wisconsin judge on charges of obstructing immigration enforcement.\n\n\"I'm horrified by what's going on,\" said James Kainen, 71, a law professor at Fordham University and a former assistant U.S. attorney in the Southern District of New York. \"We had ethics. We prosecuted people because they violated the law, not because they angered somebody for some ridiculous reason.\"\n\nMr. Kainen held up a sign that said \"I want Perkins Coie as my law firm,\" referring to a firm that Mr. Trump has targeted with an executive order.\n\nOrganizers of the Foley Square rally instructed attendees to dress \"as if they were appearing in court,\" and encouraged them to carry pocket Constitutions.\n\n\"We want people to see that we treat this issue with utmost respect,\" said Ron Minkoff, a criminal defense lawyer and an organizer. \"This is like the courtroom to us.\"\n\nIt was not exactly a mass street protest. The jurists voiced their disapproval by ceremonially reaffirming their oath to upholding the rule of law. But the fact that lawyers are not famous for participating in demonstrations, organizers said, underscored the seriousness of the moment.\n\n\"If lawyers are taking to the streets, it means something very serious and bad is happening,\" said Traci Feit Love, the executive director of Lawyers for Good Government, a nonprofit that helped coordinate the events.\n\nThe administration's wrongful deportation of Kilmar Abrego Garcia and Mr. Trump's threats against judges were motivations for the day of action, but the president's targeting of elite law firms was a particular focus for some. Mr. Trump has unleashed a flurry of executive orders aimed at crippling firms he says have used the justice system against him. The orders have limited the firms' access to federal buildings and canceled their government contracts.\n\nTrump Administration: Live Updates\n\nUpdated\n\nMay 1, 2025, 3:34 p.m. ET55 minutes ago\n\nHawaii announced a climate lawsuit. So the government sued Hawaii first.New videos aim to persuade Chinese nationals to spy for the C.I.A.A Texas judge strikes down Trump's use of the Alien Enemies Act to deport Venezuelans.\n\nIn March, some of those firms started cutting deals, pledging pro bono legal support for Mr. Trump's causes in exchange for relief from his executive actions. Angered by the capitulations, organizations such as the New York County Lawyers Association and the New York Civil Liberties Union started discussing ways to stand up for what they saw as an assault on their profession.\n\n\"We're deeply concerned about the response of some of the major law firms,\" said Dawn Cardi, a defense lawyer who also helped organize the event in New York. \"It feels a little bit like I imagine it felt in the McCarthy era.\"\n\nSince the event was first envisioned, a growing number of firms have fought back, calling Mr. Trump's actions unconstitutional. Even the firms that have capitulated have seen internal dissent.\n\nLast week, lawyers for Perkins Coie and WilmerHale, both targeted by Mr. Trump, asked the courts to permanently block the orders. Hundreds of firms have signed briefs backing Perkins Coie. Last week, a federal judge stopped Mr. Trump from targeting the firm Susman Godfrey, calling it \"a shocking abuse of power.\"\n\nJ.B. Howard, a counsel in global litigation at Cadwalader, resigned after his firm made a deal with Mr. Trump.\n\nIn an interview, Mr. Howard, 61, stressed that he was not angry at his firm for its decision. But he said he feared the consequences for his profession, and worried about the example he would set for his son, a law student, if he continued to work for a firm that had capitulated to Mr. Trump.\n\n\"I just can't be a practicing lawyer feeling as though I have abandoned a sacred obligation,\" Mr. Howard said. On Thursday, he attended a Law Day event in Denver, where he, along with more than 100 lawyers, entered the federal courthouse and retook their oaths.\n\nMore junior lawyers and law students have been outspoken about their outrage, even as they acknowledge the professional risks.\n\nHope Elizabeth Guzzle, a first-year law student at Fordham who attended the rally in New York, said the Trump administration's attack on legal norms had helped convince her to pursue a career in public interest law, rather than corporate law.\n\n\"The one place where there is still concern for norms and fighting back is in the law,\" said Ms. Guzzle, 24, who wore courtroom attire and held a sign that said \"Why am I even studying for my Con Law exam?\"\n\nA group of Georgetown University law students has created a spreadsheet of firms that color-codes them by whether they've capitulated to Mr. Trump, an effort first reported by the site All Rise News. In April, three anonymous law students filed suit against the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, asking a federal court to bar firms from handing over sensitive information about employees to the administration.\n\nOn Tuesday, more than 1,000 law students filed an amicus brief supporting Susman Godfrey in its fight against Mr. Trump. Sam Haddad, a second-year law student at Yale Law School who signed the brief, said the Trump administration's attack on the rule of law -- and how many big firms had cut deals -- had given him pause about his career path.\n\n\"I now understand that legal professionals can hesitate, or worse, capitulate when the crisis is clear and the need to respond is unambiguous,\" Mr. Haddad, who worked at Susman as a fellow last summer, said in an interview.\n\nMr. Howard said that the firms' decisions would cost them in the fullness of time.\n\n\"These firms that are capitulating are kind of toxic to young lawyers and the next generation of lawyers,\" he said.",

                "title": "Logging devastated Victoria's native forests - and new research shows 20% has failed to grow back",
                "body": "Following the end of native logging in Victoria on January 1 2024, the state's majestic forests might be expected to regenerate and recover naturally. But our new research shows that's not always the case.\n\nWe quantified the extent of regeneration following logging in the eucalypt forests of southeastern Australia between 1980 and 2019. This included nearly 42,000 hectares of logged mountain ash forest in Victoria's Central Highlands.\n\nWe analysed satellite data, logging records, on-ground surveys and drone photography, and discovered that nearly 20% of logged areas failed to regenerate. This represents more than 8,000 hectares of forest lost. All that remains in these areas are grassy clearings, dense shrublands or bare soils.\n\nWe also found the rate of regeneration failure has increased over the past decade. While failure was rare in the 1980s, it became much more common over time - affecting more than 80% of logged sites by 2019.\n\nThese regeneration failures weren't random. They were found mostly in close proximity to each other, on areas with steep slopes, relatively low elevation, and where the area of clear-felled forest was long and narrow.\n\nOur research shows more needs to be done to restore Victoria's forest after logging.\n\nRestoring majestic forests and their vital services\n\nVictoria is home to some of the most spectacular forests on the planet. They include extensive stands of mountain ash, the tallest flowering plant on Earth, which can grow to almost 100 metres in height. Alpine ash, another giant, can grow up to 60m tall.\n\nThese forests have great cultural significance to Indigenous people and support many recreational and tourism activities.\n\nHealthy forest ecosystems also deliver clean water and carbon storage services. In fact, mountain ash forests contain more carbon per hectare than most other forests around the world.\n\nBut Victoria's forests have long been logged for timber and pulp. The main method of logging - clearfelling - scars the landscape, leaving large areas devoid of trees if natural tree regeneration fails.\n\nMountain ash is especially vulnerable\n\nOur research revealed 19.2% of areas logged between 1980 and 2019 in our study area (8,030ha out of 41,819ha cut) failed to regenerate naturally.\n\nWe also found strong evidence of a significant increase in the extent of failed regeneration over 40 years, increasing from less than two hectares per cutblock in 1980 (about 7.5%) to more than nine hectares per cutblock in 2019 (about 85%), on average.\n\nWe found regeneration failure was more likely in mountain ash forests compared with other forest types.\n\nThis adds to the case for listing the mountain ash forests of the Central Highlands of Victoria as a threatened ecological community.\n\nA responsibility to restore\n\nUnder Victoria's Code of Forest Practice for Timber Production, logged native forests must be properly regenerated within two to three years of harvest.\n\nThat's because it is nearly impossible for the native forest to regenerate after three years without human intervention. The young trees face too much competition from grass and shrubs.\n\nThese degraded areas no longer hold the value they once did and they cannot provide the same level of ecosystem services such as carbon storage, water purification, or habitat for wildlife.\n\nWith no current government restoration plan, these landscapes will remain degraded indefinitely. The Victorian government retains legal responsibility to restore these degraded forests, but currently lacks any large-scale restoration strategy, making action urgently required.\n\nA way forward: using green bonds to fund regeneration\n\nOur research shows the regeneration of forests after logging is not guaranteed. Nature often needs a helping hand. But we need to find ways to fund these projects.\n\nGlobally, governments have used \"green bonds\" to lower the cost of borrowing tied explicitly to measurable environmental results.\n\nVictoria already has green bonds \"to finance new and existing projects that offer climate change and environmental benefits\". But funds are typically used to finance investments in transport, renewable energy, water and low carbon buildings.\n\nAs part of a coalition of researchers, environmental organisations, and finance sector partners we proposed a A$224 million green bond for forest regeneration. This proposal was put to the Victorian government via the Treasury Corporation of Victoria.\n\nGreen bond funding would help leverage co-investment from the Commonwealth government and philanthropic partners to improve monitoring and biodiversity outcomes in native forests.\n\nAs part of the proposed green bond, areas of logged forest where natural regeneration has failed would be restored.\n\nOther investments under the green bond could include creating tourism ventures (and associated jobs), controlling feral animals such as deer, and biodiversity recovery - creating habitat for endangered species such as the southern greater glider and Leadbeater's possum, for example.\n\nThe $224 million required for the ten years of the green bond -- or around $22.4 million per year -- is less than the substantial losses Victoria incurred on its investment in VicForests over the past decade.\n\nOur research suggests leaving nature to its own devices would mean losing a fifth of the forests logged over the past 40 years. Bringing the trees back has multiple benefits and would be well worth the investment.",

                "body": "Want to stay updated on what's happening in Israel and the West Bank and Gaza Strip? Sign up for Your Places: Global Update, and we'll send our latest coverage to your inbox.\n\nA top Trump appointee in the Justice Department ordered an aggressive investigation in the last several months of student protesters at Columbia University, raising anger and alarm among career prosecutors and investigators who saw the demand as politically motivated and lacking legal merit, people familiar with the episode said.\n\nThe demand for the inquiry into students who protested Israel's conduct of the conflict in Gaza also prompted pushback from a federal magistrate judge, who believed some of the steps being sought by the official were unjustified and might violate the First Amendment, the people said.\n\nThe breadth of the investigation, conducted by the Justice Department's civil rights division, has not been previously reported. The ensuing clash highlights the tensions roiling the department as administration officials seek to enact President Trump's agenda, including redirecting the civil rights division away from its traditional approach of protecting the rights of minority groups with a new mission to fulfill a campaign promise by cracking down on student protesters amid accusations of rampant antisemitism on college campuses.\n\nThose types of demands from political appointees at the Justice Department are part of the reason there has been an exodus of lawyers from the division in recent weeks, according to current and former officials.\n\nThe federal investigation into student protesters at Columbia appears to have stalled for now, but it represents one of the most contentious episodes yet inside the Justice Department during Mr. Trump's second term. The dispute has left lingering ill will within the department, as well as the courts and the F.B.I., the people said.\n\nAsked for comment, Todd Blanche, the deputy attorney general, said, \"This is a false story fabricated by a group of people who allowed antisemitism and support of Hamas terrorists to fester for several years, standing by but doing nothing.\"\n\nThe Trump administration has vowed to take on campus protests against Israel's military campaign in the Gaza Strip, saying they reflect antisemitism that must be punished. Those efforts are aimed at both college administrators, who Trump officials say should have done more to rein in campus protests, and student activists themselves, some of whom immigration officials have detained. Activists, in turn, accuse the authorities of conflating criticism of Israeli and U.S. policy with antisemitism.\n\nJustice Dept.'s Criminal Inquiry of Columbia Protesters Raised Alarms Internally - The New York Times\n\nThe investigation began shortly after masked protesters barged into Milbank Hall, a building at Barnard College, on Feb. 26 to demonstrate against the expulsion of students who had been accused of disrupting a \"History of Modern Israel\" class. Video shows students pushing past a security guard and occupying a hallway. School officials said at the time that the guard was assaulted and taken to the hospital for minor injuries.\n\nEmil Bove III, a senior Justice Department official, ordered an immediate investigation, primarily of one particular student group, Columbia University Apartheid Divest, according to three people with knowledge of the matter, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss details intended to remain private.\n\nProdded by Mr. Bove, prosecutors in the civil rights division were told to obtain a membership list of the group. Investigators, however, pushed back on those instructions because they were skeptical such a list even existed, given the amorphous nature of online forums, and even if it did, scrutinizing people for their membership seemed like a possible violation of their First Amendment rights, these people said.\n\nOne of the Justice Department lawyers assigned to the case was Samantha Trepel, an experienced civil rights prosecutor who secured a federal conviction against Derek Chauvin, the Minneapolis police officer who killed George Floyd in 2020, these people said.\n\nThe prosecutors were told by superiors that Mr. Bove was seeking a list so the information could be shared with immigration agents, these people said. Inside the civil rights division, prosecutors came to fear that their criminal investigation was a pretext to facilitate an intimidation and deportation campaign by the Trump administration against student protesters, these people said. Prosecutors refused to compile such a list that could be given to Immigration and Customs Enforcement agents, these people said.\n\nMr. Bove then shifted his focus to obtaining a search warrant for the group's Instagram account, these people said. He ordered prosecutors to apply for a search warrant for the nonpublic data associated with the account, these people said.\n\nThe premise of the application was also contentious within the department. Mr. Bove insisted that the Instagram account in question had been used to make a threat, while line prosecutors said the statement at issue did not meet the legal definition of a threat, these people said. In late March, the social media company suspended the group's account for failing to meet its \"community standards.\"\n\nMr. Blanche, in his statement, added that the warrant application focused on Columbia University Apartheid Divest \"included a photograph from C.U.A.D.'s social media of an inverted triangle symbol used by Hamas to designate targets for violence, which was spray-painted on Columbia property along with red paint designed to look like blood.\"\n\nHe said the investigation was \"ongoing,\" appearing to point to a related criminal investigation that the federal authorities have pursued, one that \"included an independent magistrate judge finding probable cause to believe that there was evidence on Columbia property of harboring and concealing illegal aliens.\"\n\nBefore Mr. Trump delivered a speech to the Justice Department on March 14, Mr. Blanche told the audience that the department was investigating whether anyone involved in the campus protests at Columbia violated civil rights laws and antiterrorism laws.\n\nMr. Blanche projected unwavering certainty about the wisdom of such an investigation. But behind the scenes, career lawyers had profound doubts about the merits of the case they were assigned, and deep concerns about the potential consequences if they refused.\n\nMr. Bove's demands frustrated people in the civil rights division, but many of the managers were afraid to push back, having watched a month earlier as Mr. Bove pressed prosecutors in a different division, the public integrity section, to drop criminal charges against Mayor Eric Adams of New York, the three people said. That section, which once had about 30 lawyers, now has only a handful.\n\nBennett Gershman, a Pace University law professor who specializes in prosecutorial ethics, said the described conduct of Mr. Bove was \"staggering.\"\n\n\"He did something that prosecutors are absolutely forbidden to do -- use the law enforcement powers of the government to try to intimidate these individuals or destroy their rights,\" Mr. Gershman said. \"This is so far past the line of prosecutorial professionalism and the commitment to principles of justice.\"\n\nIn his statement, Mr. Blanche said that \"unethical and inaccurate claims from deep state terrorist sympathizers who stood by as members of the Jewish faith were targeted across the country\" would not deter Pam Bondi, the attorney general, and the Justice Department from \"aggressively investigating criminal conduct and rooting out antisemitism.\"\n\nWhen the federal prosecutors involved in the investigation of student protesters applied for a search warrant, a magistrate judge in New York rejected the request, finding that the government did not have sufficient probable cause, these people said.\n\nIn an unusual move, Mr. Bove insisted that the prosecutors appeal the ruling to a district court judge, these people said. After weighing the request, Judge John G. Koeltl of Federal District Court of the Southern District of New York instructed the chief magistrate judge, Sarah Netburn, to reconsider the application, the people said.\n\nBut the second time, the government lawyers fared even worse. Judge Netburn not only rejected the request for a search warrant, but she also ordered the government to abide by a special condition: Should prosecutors ever try to refile such an application before another federal judge, they had to include a transcript of the sealed discussions in her court, these people said.\n\nPart of the judge's skepticism, these people said, stemmed from the absence from the case of lawyers with the Manhattan federal prosecutor's office. But prosecutors in the Southern District of New York were wary of signing onto the effort and had minimal involvement with it, these people said. A spokesman for the U.S. attorney's office in Manhattan declined to comment.\n\nWhile civil rights prosecutors conducted the investigation that Mr. Bove had demanded, they often pushed back against specific steps that he wanted taken, these people said, arguing that they were either not justified by the available facts or contrary to law and past practice, or both.\n\nAt one point, Mr. Bove instructed F.B.I. agents on the joint terrorism task force in New York to put on their raid jackets, go to Columbia's campus and stand in a phalanx near any protesters. Within the civil rights division, the instruction was viewed as deeply improper and a blatant attempt to intimidate students, these people said. The F.B.I. agents did not make any such show of force.\n\nBy early April, the investigation seemed to have largely died, but nothing prevents Mr. Bove or others from reviving it. In its wake, however, people familiar with the case said it had only exacerbated the ill will and distrust between political appointees at the Justice Department's headquarters in Washington and the prosecutor's office in New York, as well as between those political appointees and veterans of the civil rights division.",

                "title": "The Greens say land-based salmon farming is viable. The Tasmanian industry says otherwise",
                "body": "Tasmania's salmon industry -- a $1.3 billion operation concentrated mostly in the state's south -- has become a contentious political topic this federal election campaign.\n\nIt produced almost 75,000 tonnes of Atlantic salmon in the 2022-23 financial year, and those in support of the industry argue it's an important economic contributor to the state, while providing employment to regional communities.\n\nThe industry, made up of three foreign-owned companies -- Tassal, Huon and Petuna -- has recently found itself at the centre of several environmental incidents, and has played a key role in a last-minute law change by Anthony Albanese's Labor government.\n\nNot long after, video released of live salmon being placed into bins with dead fish resulted in Huon losing its RSPCA certification.\n\nThe industry has been criticised by conservation and environmental groups for years over its impact on the endangered Maugean skate, a ray-like fish found only in Macquarie Harbour.\n\nTo mitigate the impacts to marine areas, environmental groups such as Neighbours of Fish Farming (NOFF) have argued that commercially-farmed salmon could be moved to land-based operations.\n\nThey say land-based farming also minimises the spread of disease, reducing the need for antibiotics, and removes noise and light pollution for coastal communities.\n\nIt's a strategy the salmon industry strongly opposes, arguing the move to 100 per cent land-based farming would be economically, logistically and politically unrealistic.\n\nThe push to land-based salmon farming\n\nIn Tasmania, commercially grown salmon starts in freshwater land-based hatcheries, before being moved to saltwater open-pen farms on maturity.\n\nLand-based farming uses Recirculating Aquaculture Systems (RAS), a controlled environment that reuses water and limits the movement of fish.\n\nOn Wednesday, Tasmanian Greens Senator Nick McKim announced a new policy to force salmon farms out of the state's coastal waters and in to land-based farms.\n\nThe Greens' proposal includes $50 million of Commonwealth funding for environmental remediation, independent monitoring of salmon farms for compliance with animal cruelty and environmental standards, and a \"jobs transition package\" for Macquarie Harbour workers.\n\nUnder the policy, the salmon industry would self-fund its transition to land-based farming.\n\nThe Greens have not put a timeline on the completion of the transition.\n\nTasmania's salmon industry is regulated by the state government.\n\nMr McKim said there were \"plenty of levers that can be pulled\" at a state level to instigate the transition.\n\n\"There's no doubt that the powers exist to transition the industry on shore and to force it to transition on shore,\" he said.\n\nThe Tasmanian government has not supported the Greens' policy.\n\nIndependent federal candidate for Franklin and Climate-200-backed anti-salmon campaigner, Peter George, has also flagged land-based aquaculture as an environmentally positive alternative.\n\nMr George took leave from his role as NOFF's president to challenge federal Fisheries Minister Julie Collins in the federal election.\n\nWhy the Tasmanian industry says it can't work\n\nLuke Martin, outgoing chief executive of the industry's peak body Salmon Tasmania, dismissed the case for 100-per-cent land-based farming as \"voodoo economics\".\n\n\"It will never get to a point where you do the entire production period, the entire two-year life cycle of the fish, on land,\" Mr Martin said.\n\nHe said large amounts of water, energy and land would be required to transition the industry, requirements he deemed unfeasible.\n\nMr Martin also argued that the cost of moving the industry to land-based farms was significant and would drive up the price of the product, making it economically unviable.\n\n\"We're talking about giant artificial ponds, enormous tanks built into the Tasmanian landscape -- which community would be lining up to put their hand up in Tasmania?\" he said.\n\nHowever, he said the industry was investigating how it could expand the amount of time fish spend on land before being transferred to marine pens -- with an eye to expanding operations.\n\n\"And then secure leases in deeper water, into more open water areas like outer Storm Bay, potentially off the coast.\"\n\nMr Martin said if land-based farming did become feasible, he believed the industry would move closer to bigger mainland markets to minimise costs.\n\nHas it worked elsewhere?\n\nOther commercially grown finfish, such as barramundi, are farmed at land-based facilities in Queensland and the Northern Territory at far smaller volumes than Atlantic salmon.\n\nInternationally, most industrial-scale salmon farming takes place in open-net pens out on the water.\n\nHowever, land-based commercial Atlantic salmon farms do exist, and have been implemented at small scale in many countries -- most notably in the US, Canada, Japan and Europe.\n\nThe scale of production at these land-based locations is far smaller than their ocean counterparts.\n\nThe largest example of land-based RAS aquaculture is Florida-based company, Atlantic Sapphire, which raises salmon in a \"bluehouse\", a climate-controlled indoor facility that minimises the risk of disease and environmental contamination.\n\nBut profitability remains a challenge.\n\nIn 2023, the company harvested just over 1,500 tonnes, a decrease of about 700 tonnes from the previous year.\n\nCanada is the world's fourth-largest producer of Atlantic salmon, with the majority of its industry farming in west coast waters off Vancouver Island in British Columbia.\n\nIt is attempting to transition part of its billion-dollar industry to land-based practices.\n\nIn June last year, the Canadian government promised to ban marine salmon farming in British Columbia by 2029, citing environmental concerns and the need to protect wild salmon populations.\n\nThe plan has left the region's peak-industry body, the British Columbia Salmon Farmers Association, concerned and doubtful it can be achieved without significant job losses.\n\nIts executive director, Brian Kingzett, told the ABC the estimated cost to transition the industry was more than 2 billion Canadian dollars.\n\n\"Much like Tasmania, we're largely a remote island. Our salmon farms are in rural areas, we don't have the power grid or the land to support on-land aquaculture.\"",

                "body": "The Duke of Sussex has well and truly flipped the script and is trying something completely new this year, leaving many agahst.\n\nWe love a mystery. A gone girl, a podcast, a true crime investigation, which is handy because we are faced with a Sherlockian puzzler that will require a magnifying glass and everyone bringing a packed lunch to try and solve.\n\nHave you noticed? Something strange and unusual of late? Something missing? A certain silence, a space, a void? A one time super glued-on fixture of news headlines, a mainstay of People covers and all round general thorn in the side of the British royal family?\n\nSo far, 2025 has to be the quietest year on record for the 40-year-old who appears to have vanished into the honeysuckled thin air of Montecito.\n\nThe royal father-of-two has, this year, seem to have become something of a comparative recluse, keeping his head firmly down.\n\nThere have been no denunciations of the press in interviews or speeches given on New York stages where, dark blue-suited, he passionately rails against the ills of social media or him, tan-blazered, raising funds for his mainstay charities.\n\nDitto, no polo, no red carpets, no TV projects, no books, no podcasts, no beachy holidays, no Katy Perry concerts, no private jets, no drinks at Ellen's place and no even being papped leaving a local Santa Barbara restaurant after putting away a T-bone.\n\nWe are living in a very strange Sussex-y time indeed.\n\nBy and large this year, the vast majority of the times the duke has been seen, it has been being one half of a double act with his wife Meghan, The Duchess of Sussex. In January the couple found themselves, wholly unfairly, at the centre of a bit of a s**tstorm after they turned up to lend a hand during the LA fires before Harry, very much on the down low, occasionally popped up to thank first responders.\n\nHe also made a blink-and-you'll-miss-it appearance at One805's Rock for Responders\n\nfundraiser in LA.\n\nIn February, for one week, it was High Wattage Harry A-Go-Go at the Invictus Games in Vancouver.\n\nIn March he earned himself not even an IMDB credit with a cameo in the final episode of his wife's generally critically panned With Love, Meghan playing his favourite role, beamingly adoring husband.\n\nIn April he flew to London to attend court where he is legally challenging what is technically his father's government over his security arrangements, having lost his automatic police protection in 2020.\n\nLast week, we got another chance to really prove he's the world's proudest Wife Guy when he played supportive plus one when the duchess spoke at the TIME100 Summit in New York.\n\nAlso during that trip, the Sussexes unveiled the Lost Screen Memorial which remembers 50 young people who have lost their lives due to harms of social media.\n\nHarry, as far as I can tell, has not done a day of publicly facing paid work. Despite being the Chief Impact Officer of coaching platform BetterUp he did not appear at their recent Uplift Summit, an event he spoke at for the previous four years.\n\nWe are at least 120 days into 2025 so far and Harry has been seen on fewer of them than there have been UFO sightings in New Jersey. (Because where else would the alien invasion begin but in the birthplace of disco fries and Danny DeVito?)\n\nNever has there been a time in the last two decades, by and large, that the world has seen so little of the Duke of Sussex.\n\nHas Harry, I wonder, pulled off something truly extraordinary - by and large is this the shockingly quiet, peaceful life he always dreamed about? Where he can do Dad things like pickups and drop offs and where no one is busy defining him as the Boy Who Will Never Be King?\n\nAfter all, he has told his story, cashed the cheques and, maybe, given up on expectantly waiting by the phone for his father King Charles to stutter out some sort of half-hearted 'sorry' over the yapping of the Jack Russells.\n\nThat's one view. Another is that, five years on from Megxit, the Duke of Sussex's life has ended up in something of a cul-de-sac.\n\nLast month he revealed he was 'heartbroken' to have parted ways with Sentebale, the charity that he and Prince Seeiso of Lesotho co-founded nearly 20 years ago, the duo along with the rest of the trustees having resigned in protest over chairwoman Dr Sophie Chandauka. Dr Chandauka has accused Harry and the organisation of \"bullying and harassment at scale\".\n\nThe UK's Charity Commission is currently investigating concerns about the Sentebale.\n\nI'm absolutely sure that Harry does a hell of a lot of work behind the scenes for the Invictus and the Sussexes' Archewell Foundation's projects, we are a hell of long way off the 152 engagements, at least, that he clocked up in his final full year of official royal life in 2019.\n\nThe interesting contrast here is that Harry appears to have withdrawn from view while Meghan is more out there and in the limiest of lights, appearing on podcasts (her own and a friend's), being interviewed by the New York Times, debuting her Netflix show, launching her As Ever range of food products and posting, posting, posting over on Instagram.\n\nAs anyone who lives near a fault line knows, the thing to do in an earthquake is \"duck and cover\". Who knew he would seemingly take it so very literally?",

Go to a red state. Go hold a town hall. Go to El Salvador, whatever it may be,\" Psaki said on the late-night show.\n\n\"People want to know you're fighting and doing things.

Multiple editors, including an admin who was formerly part of the site's Arbitration Committee akin to a Supreme Court, suggested the site's Foundation owners say \"fuck off\" or \"fuck off Nazi\" as their official response.\n\nCriticism also focused on Martin's requests to the Foundation showing a misunderstanding of the group's role in governing Wikipedia. However, while the Foundation largely avoided interfering with the community previously, in recent years it has imposed a left-wing \"code of conduct\" on all Foundation-owned sites like Wikipedia, though enforcement is largely delegated to volunteers. Prior attempts at more direct enforcement of policy have prompted editor revolts. Although there were also suggestions Martin raised legitimate concerns, many editors insisted Martin's concerns were not genuine and his objection was \"facts\" on Wikipedia contradicted his and the Trump Administration's views with their intention being to intimidate and co-opt the site.\n\nEditors in a wider community discussion launched into attacks on Martin. Administrator \"Voorts\" called Martin a \"clown\" in a hostile rant. Several editors followed up by making other attacks with administrator \"Llywrch\" claiming \"those around the short-fingered convicted felon\" were either clowns or incompetent hacks along with other incendiary political statements. Yet another editor responded to this stating they, including Martin, were \"killer clowns\" and \"literally supporting more than one genocide\" at the moment. Editor \"Cambalachero\" commented in the middle of this discussion to note that Wikipedia's policies on claims about living people still apply in the discussion, though none of the editors modified their remarks.\n\nAdministrator \"Bishonen\" wryly suggested creating a Wikipedia article about the letter itself. Her comments unfavorably referenced an Indian court case against the Foundation and how an article created about the court case had to be pulled down on the order of the court, while suggesting an article about Martin's letter would more likely stay up. Bishonen has previously used her privileges to favor left-wing editors on the violent far-left Antifa group and the GamerGate anti-corruption movement in gaming.\n\nMartin's Wikipedia page was also vandalized shortly after the letter's release by non-account users calling him a \"Nazi\" and a \"cuckold\" with another labeling him \"far-right\" repeatedly before an admin, a user with special privileges, locked the page so only registered accounts over a few days old with multiple edits could edit. However, the \"far-right\" label was soon added back by an admitted Trump critic who added a paragraph labeling Martin a \"conspiracy theorist\" citing blogs and opinion pieces, despite such sourcing violating policy and the label was also added to the first sentence of Martin's article.\n\nOne editor added negative material about Martin's involvement in a leadership battle over the conservative Eagle Forum founded by Phyllis Schlafly, without noting any material from the source describing members of the Schlafly family supporting Martin's position and defending his conduct. Another editor added a line to the first paragraph of the article stating Martin \"has a history of making incendiary claims about opponents and causing ethical and legal controversies\" citing a single ProPublica article, which itself sourced its statement to a piece at left-wing Media Matters.\n\nWhen an editor attempted to remove several labels attacking Martin from the first paragraph of his page, editor Paul Lee, who edits as \"Valjean\" on Wikipedia and is an obsessively anti-Trump editor, restored them. Administrator \"Zzuzz\" later removed the \"conspiracy theorist\" label, but the \"far-right\" label was restored by Bishonen after another editor removed that label citing a paragraph that had exactly one source using the label. Site policy is that articles on people should avoid contentious terms in the first sentence in favor of those widely used in sources deemed reliable on Wikipedia.\n\nSite co-founder Larry Sanger also was targeted as a result of the opening post in the community discussion stating he was \"involved\" in the letter. Sanger was merely mentioned for his criticisms of Wikipedia, but several editors attacked Sanger as complicit in Martin's letter with one editor calling him extreme and dismissing as \"ridiculous\" his criticisms of the site's left-wing bias. Previously, Sanger has been smeared by Wikipedia editors over his criticism of the site.\n\nMultiple editors suggested there was some credibility to the criticism or concern in the discussion, but this often received a hostile response from other editors. When Cambalachero suggested responding seriously to Martin, another editor insisted the letter was \"intimidation by a government that does not like press freedom, free speech, academic liberty, sciences, and more broadly knowledge.\"\n\nCambalachero criticized the suggestion of there being a conspiracy to silence Wikipedia, but several editors objected with one arguing Musk along with others were trying to silence Wikipedia, though deferred on whether it was a conspiracy. Editor Andy Mabbett insisted a conspiracy existed with Musk specifically identified as involved along with the Heritage Foundation. As evidence against Musk, he merely cited an article about Musk criticizing Wikipedia for negatively-slanted edits about him and general issues of political bias. Mabbett has served as a \"Wikipedian in Residence\" at numerous research institutions and universities and organized various editing events at others.\n\nRegarding the Heritage Foundation, which has been alleged to be looking to uncover the real identities of editors engaged in antisemitic editing, Cambalachero said its goal was sympathetic. However, several editors objected that it was not about antisemitism with editor \"Viriditas\" insisting Republicans do not care about Jews and comparing Jews who support Republicans to \"kapos in Nazi-era WWII who helped their fellow Jews to their deaths\" in concentration camps.\n\n\"North8000\" suggested they \"create and publicize initiatives to find systemic fixes\" to Wikipedia's bias on politics to address criticism. Some editors were sympathetic to the suggestion, but editor \"Simonm223\" criticized the idea by claiming \"the far-right\" wants Wikipedia's \"submission\" rather than neutrality. He further argued Wikipedia has a \"center-right\" bias, a claim previously used by the main Wikipedia community newsletter to dismiss left-wing bias claims, and that a \"neutral encyclopedia would be more critical of the Trump regime\" than Wikipedia is now. Simonm223 is a self-identified socialist that previously praised an Antifa terrorist who attacked an ICE detention facility during Trump's first term.\n\nSome editors in the discussion suggested counter-measures to evade any legal response by Martin such as moving the Wikipedia servers or the Foundation itself to another country, though many editors raised concern about which countries would allow them the same degree of freedom they currently enjoy. Other editors suggested decentralizing the site's fundraising efforts across multiple countries. Wales expressed his view in the discussion that pressure from the United States was not a serious vulnerability.\n\nVictor Grigas, a former Wikimedia Foundation staffer, suggested a \"blackout\" of the site as a protest similar to actions taken in response to copyright laws editors deemed too restrictive, though other editors were resistant. When an editor in that discussion suggested the Foundation might take steps to comply with Martin's concerns and \"threaten Wikipedia freedomness and neutral point of view\" in the process, Wales responded by rejecting the idea and referred to Martin's letter as an attack arguing \"when being attacked, one of the thing that the attackers usually want is for the attackees to turn on each other for no reason. We can be unified because we are unified.\"\n\nWikipedia has come under increasing scrutiny due to its apparent left-wing bias as identified in numerous studies. Part of the scrutiny has focused on the online encyclopedia's sourcing policies and its purging of conservative media. The site has been increasingly relied on by Big Tech platforms and praised by corporate media who have even copied its contents as with Wikipedia's extremely biased article on GamerGate. Such reliance comes in spite of Wikipedia's long history of spreading hoaxes and issues with paid editing. The Wikimedia Foundation's promotion of Wikipedia as a solution to \"fake news\" came after the firm run by the Clinton Foundation's Communications leader suggested the strategy.\n\n(Disclosure: The author has previously been involved in disputes on Wikipedia with some parties referenced in this article)",

                "body": "This week in Newly Reviewed, Holland Cotter covers Sheyla Baykal's downtown stars, a group show from a radical feminist art collective and Young Joon Kwak's quieter side.\n\nSheyla Baykal\n\nThrough May 10. Soft Network, 636 Broadway; 917-803-3620, softnetwork.art.\n\nIn the New York City art world in the 1960s, '70s and even early '80s, the descriptive terms \"downtown\" and \"underground\" were pretty much synonymous. The photographer Sheyla Baykal (1944-1997) was a vital inhabitant of that terrain, and one of its underrecognized visual historians.\n\nNow, largely thanks to the attention of another veteran avant-garde citizen -- the performance artist Penny Arcade, who has preserved Baykal's material legacy -- we have a thrilling view into those decades in an exhibition at Soft Network, a gallery devoted to preserving artists' estates.\n\nBorn in the United States and raised in Turkey, Baykal was herself a sought-after photographic subject as a Ford agency fashion model in the 1960s. But she also carried a camera of her own and had it trained on the New York's art scene. Through a family connection she had entree into the Abstract Expressionist circles of an earlier day; Willem and Elaine de Kooning, well along in years, were among her subjects.\n\nHer focus, though, was a new, venturesome, primarily gay world of performance-intensive art, and her photos give us an archival treasury of images. She documented the extravagant theatrics of West Coast hippie drag collectives like the Cockettes and the Angels of Light, and the New York performer and filmmaker Jack Smith.\n\nBaykal eventually came to favor portraiture as a genre. And some of the most radical talents associated with Manhattan's pre-gentrified East Village scene sat for her: Bette Bourne of Bloolips fame; the performance-art dream team of Ethyl Eichelberger and Agosto Machado; the genius installation artist Paul Thek; and the photographer laureate of the underground, Peter Hujar (his ineffable 1976 book, \"Portraits in Life and Death,\" has recently been republished by Liveright).\n\nAIDS and age have taken most of these beings from us, but they all appear in the Soft Network exhibition of Baykal photographs, videos and ephemera organized by the art historian Marcelo Gabriel Yáñez with Penny Arcade. And at a time when, by presidential order, all things L.G.B.T.Q. are being officially whited out from the record, Baykal and her subjects glow like the art-firmamental stars they were, and are.\n\nNancy Brooks Brody, Joy Episalla, Zoe Leonard and Carrie Yamaoka\n\nThrough May 11. Participant, Inc., 116 Elizabeth Street; 646-492-4076, participantinc.org.\n\nThis small, grave, beautiful show brings together work by four of the founding members of Fierce Pussy, a radical lesbian feminist art collective. It also stands as a memorial to one of its members, the much-missed Nancy Brooks Brody, who died in 2023.\n\nThe collective emerged in 1991 as an offshoot of the activist group ACT UP (AIDS Coalition to Unleash Power). It focused attention particularly on the effects of the AIDS epidemic on women, and did so through the production of street-level, no-budget forms of protest art like wheat-pasted posters and guerrilla-style actions.\n\nThe Participant exhibition, organized by Jo-ey Tang, begins with a reminder of this history at the gallery entrance, with a stack of takeaway posters emblazoned with the phrase \"I got all my sisters with me\" (a quote from the 1979 Sister Sledge song \"We Are Family\"). But the show itself is about the individual work of the four founding artists, much of which seems to be addressing the vulnerability of art itself, and particularly of art by queer women, in a hostile culture.\n\nZoe Leonard's photograph of a gnarled city tree pushing through fencing reads as a cleareyed, poetic study in struggle. So does a floor piece by Carrie Yamaoka composed of fabric remnants of a ruined couch or bed, but with all the textile fragments neatly folded so as to look precious, not abject, or maybe both. Similarly, Joy Episalla's large sculpture made of creased and crumpled photographic paper comes across both as fodder for a compactor and as a bold statement of anti-monumentalism.\n\nAnd a few modest-size works by Brody suggest why she is so missed. One, a black-and-white painting of wavy lines, carries the gritty title of \"Glory Hole\" but looks like an ethereal Agnes Martin grid shimmying and dancing. A sculpture consisting of two small triangular strips of black metal embedded high up in a gallery wall almost escapes detection but, once noticed, grips, the eye and mind: Is it meant to suggest a wound? An ornament? A surveillance device? It's a lesson in how, in the right hands, \"not much\" can fire questions in every direction and be absolutely, powerfully there.\n\nYoung Joon Kwak\n\nThrough July 27. Leslie-Lohman Museum of Art, 26 Wooster Street; 212-431-2609, leslielohman.org.\n\nBorn in Queens in 1984 and now based in Los Angeles, the artist Young Joon Kwak, who is Korean American and transgender, covers a lot of ground media-wise. A sculptor and video artist, they co-founded an electronic-dance-noise band called Xina Xurner in 2011; they were, and are, the rousing lead singer. A year later, in Los Angeles, Kwak turned their studio into a communal space called the Mutant Salon, where queer, trans and femme-based projects could be developed.\n\nMuch of this work was visually and aurally raucous. But the Leslie-Lohman show -- organized by Stamatina Gregory, the museum's head curator -- is the opposite: spare, quiet. A large, seemingly abstract recent ceramic sculpture called \"Femmes (Nic, Toria, Tala)\" is a cast of the embracing bodies of three nonbinary friends. Another work, \"Veil (Lulu),\" is made from a pair of glitter-coated ceramic arms and hands open in a gesture of benedictory welcome. A third, \"Divine Ruin (Stamatina and Young),\" is in the form of what appears to be two overlapped faces encrusted with glistening rhinestones. All are images of joining, unity, community.\n\nAnother version of \"Divine Ruin,\" this one a self-portrait of the artist, is in an exhibition called \"The Shape of Power: Stories of Race and American Sculpture\" at the Smithsonian Museum of American Art in Washington. That show has been singled out for condemnation in one of the recent presidential executive orders that have accused cultural institutions of promoting divisive \"ideology\" around the subjects of gender and race.\n\nSo, in the spirit of timeliness, let me recommend three additional New York exhibitions that keep the spark of Resisterhood burning. The group show \"Ficciones Patógenas,\" also at Leslie-Lohman, addresses the torturous history of Indigenous gender diversity under European colonialism in the Americas. For \"Deviations\" at James Fuentes, the artist Oscar yi Hou has assembled, pretty much on the fly, a survey of his downtown-ish artist-friends, most of them trans or gay. And P.P.O.W. has the first New York solo show in 15 years of the Cuban-born painter Manuel Pardo (1952-2012). He was a fixture of the East Village art world of the 1980s, who, with his early nude self-portraits and later images of his imperiously glam mother, deserves a hero's welcome back to town.\n\nSee the April gallery shows here.",

Witnesses reported that a person riding on the back of a motorcycle had hopped off and shot into the passenger side of Mr. Were's car before being whisked away by the motorcycle's driver, the police said.\n\nA motive was not immediately clear. Muchiri Nyaga, a police spokesman, said in a statement on Wednesday that it was too early for the authorities to provide additional details.\n\nPresident William Ruto of Kenya called on the police to \"conduct a thorough investigation\" and expressed his condolences to Mr. Were's family. \"Those responsible must be held to account,\" he said in a statement on Thursday.\n\nThe police said the driver and another passenger in the car were unharmed in the shooting and quickly drove Mr. Were to Nairobi Hospital, where he was pronounced dead upon arrival.\n\nMr. Were was re-elected to Parliament in 2022 as a member of the Orange Democratic Movement, the opposition party led by Raila Odinga, Mr. Ruto's main rival in the previous general election.\n\nMr. Odinga, in a statement on Thursday, compared the daytime shooting to \"a gangland-style execution\" that was \"shockingly barbaric.\"\n\nKenya has a reputation as a relatively stable nation in a volatile region. Frustration with the government hit a new high last year during deadly protests against a tax increase. Dozens of people were abducted or arbitrarily detained by security forces, according to activists and human rights groups.\n\nMr. Ruto promoted the tax increase as a necessary measure to curb the country's staggering debt.\n\nA wealthy businessman who grew up poor, Mr. Ruto campaigned on a platform of improving the economy for Kenyans.

                "body": "In an unusual move, the Trump administration pre-emptively sued Hawaii and Michigan to try to stop them from suing oil companies over global warming.\n\nOn Monday, Gov. Josh Green of Hawaii said his state intended to sue fossil fuel companies over their role in climate change to make them pay for damage from its effects, like the 2023 wildfires that devastated Maui.\n\n\"I guess this might be breaking news,\" he said during an interview on local television. \"We will be filing suit.\"\n\nOn Wednesday, the Trump administration sued Hawaii first, seeking to block the lawsuit before it could even be filed.\n\nThe Justice Department also filed a nearly identical suit against Michigan, where Attorney General Dana Nessel has retained three private law firms to pursue climate change litigation but has not yet sued. The main thrust of the administration's argument is that the federal government should determine national energy policy, not individual states.\n\nLegal experts said it was highly unusual to sue to block other lawsuits that have yet to be filed.\n\nNine Democratic-led states have already sued fossil fuel companies over climate change, along with dozens of municipalities around the country. The oil industry and its allies have tried to get those cases thrown out by making similar arguments to the ones put forth in the Justice Department filings this week.\n\nThe Justice Department did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nIts two lawsuits cite President Trump's April 8 executive order, \"Protecting American Energy From State Overreach,\" which argued that state policies inhibiting the energy industry weaken national security and drive up costs for Americans. It also said that the other lawsuits already filed by states over climate change could result in \"crippling\" damages to oil companies being sued.\n\nMichael Gerrard, director of the Sabin Center for Climate Change Law at Columbia University, said it was \"at least highly unusual\" to try and preemptively block lawsuits. \"The usual procedure would be to move to intervene in existing lawsuits,\" he said. \"I've never heard of a situation where a lawsuit is filed to seek an injunction against somebody else filing a lawsuit.\"\n\nHe predicted that such a legal strategy would not fare well. \"Procedurally, it's wacky,\" he said.\n\nBoth suits, filed in federal courts in Hawaii and Michigan, named the state, its governor and attorney general. The offices of Mr. Green and the Hawaii attorney general, Anne Lopez, did not immediately respond to requests for comment.\n\nMs. Nessel called the lawsuit \"at best frivolous and arguably sanctionable.\" She said Mr. Trump had \"made clear he will answer any and every beck and call from his Big Oil campaign donors\" and called the lawsuits \"perhaps the most surprising debasement of both the White House and D.O.J. yet.\"\n\nThe states that have already sued are California, Connecticut, Delaware, Maine, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New Jersey, Rhode Island and Vermont.",

                "body": "BELGRADE, Serbia -- Thousands of people in Serbia on Thursday marked six months since a train station tragedy in the country's north killed 16 people and triggered a wave of anti-corruption protests that have shaken populist President Aleksandar Vucic's tight grip on power.\n\nWorkers' unions joined university students in Belgrade, Serbia's capital, to demand changes in labor and strike laws as part of Labor Day protests. In the northern city of Novi Sad, residents left flowers and lit candles outside the central station where tons of concrete crashed on the people standing or sitting underneath on Nov. 1.\n\nMany in Serbia blamed alleged rampant government corruption fueling negligence and disrespect of safety regulations for the tragedy. The concrete canopy at the outer wall of the building had been renovated twice before the disaster as part of a major infrastructure deal with Chinese state companies.\n\nAlmost daily protests since the crash have developed into a nationwide movement demanding changes.\n\nThousands marched in Novi Sad on Thursday after holding a commemorative silence for the victims near the station. University students, a key force behind the anti-graft movement, set up a stone monument with an inscription saying: \"Novi Sad remembers.\"\n\n\"Today, we declared the train station building for a memorial site,\" a student told the crowd. \"It will serve as a reminder what happens when corruption takes over the state.\"\n\nIn Belgrade, union flags mixed with student banners outside the Serbian government building in a downtown area as thousands streamed in from various parts of the city for the gathering.\n\n\"Corruption kills!\" said one student, who did not say his name. \"This is why the fight against corruption must be held not only at (student) blockades but also at work place.\"\n\nPopulist supporters of President Vucic meanwhile enjoyed a May Day barbecue, drinks and folk music in a pro-government camp outside the parliament building and in an adjacent park by the presidential palace. The guarded camp, set up weeks ago, also hosted masked ex-paramilitary fighters apparently as protection for Vucic.\n\nVucic has accused the anti-graft protesters of staging a \"color revolution\" under Western instructions to oust him from power and \"destroy\" Serbia. He has organized parallel rallies to counter almost daily street demonstrations that have drawn tens of thousands of people for some of the biggest ever anti-government rallies in the country.\n\nSerbia's populist leader has faced accusations of stifling democratic freedoms, including pressure on the protesting students. In the latest incident on Monday in Novi Sad, police used batons and pepper spray while pushing protesters away from a sports faculty building. Several people were injured.\n\nSerbia is formally seeking European Union membership but the accession process recently has been stalled amid Vucic's increasing authoritarianism.",

                "body": "The Trump administration this week slashed $1 billion in so-called \"mental health\" grants for educational institutions, many of which were going to promote leftist ideology and train leftist activists.\n\nThe Education Department confirmed Wednesday that it was making cuts to grants handed out by the Biden administration ostensibly for the purpose of \"mental health\" because of the focus of many of the recipients on racially-focused programs. In a notice to Congress, the administration said it was going to \"re-envision and re-compete\" the funds allocated for mental health at schools in a gun control bill signed by former President Joe Biden.\n\n\"These grants are intended to improve American students' mental health by funding additional mental health professionals in schools and on campuses,\" Deputy Assistant Secretary for Communications Madison Biedermann said. \"Instead, under the deeply flawed priorities of the Biden Administration, grant recipients used the funding to implement race-based actions like recruiting quotas in ways that have nothing to do with mental health and could hurt the very students the grants are supposed to help.\"\n\nThe move was first reported on Tuesday by Christopher Rufo, who wrote on X that there would be \"no more slush fund for activists under the guise of mental health.\"\n\nIn March, the conservative organization Defending Education put out a report finding that the Department of Education had given at least $100,964,880 in grants to 25 universities to increase their social worker training programs ostensibly for the purpose of mental health. Defending Education found that many of these grants were going to programs steeped in leftist ideology.\n\nThis money was allocated through the Mental Health Service Professional Demonstration Grant Program and the School-Based Mental Health Services Grant Program.\n\nFor example, Portland State University was awarded $1,189,801 by the Department of Education to increase the number of social workers. DEI principles are built into the school's Master of Social Work program, the stated goal of which is to train social workers to dismantle \"systems of oppression; build[] racial equity and social, political, and economic justice.\"\n\n\"The grants were meant to support school counselors and mental health staff. In reality, they became a pipeline for training activist educators steeped in DEI, CRT, and gender ideology. Federal dollars went to universities pushing 'anti-racist social-emotional learning' and racially preferential hiring,\" said Defending Education President Nicki Neily on Thursday. \"Parents want real support for children in crisis, not counselors or social workers trained to divide, shame, and re-educate. Good on the Trump administration for ending this. Now, let's make sure the replacements actually serve students.\"",

                "body": "President Trump's Justice Department is going on the legal offensive, suing Michigan and Hawaii in two separate lawsuits ahead of the states' planned litigation against fossil fuel companies on climate change.\n\nAfter politicians in both Hawaii and Michigan announced they were planning to sue fossil fuel companies for allegedly contributing to climate change, Mr. Trump's Justice Department beat them to the courthouse.\n\nIn two similar federal lawsuits this week, the federal government argues that the states' plans run afoul of the Clean Air Act, which sets federal standards for pollution across state lines.\n\nThe feds say any state law move to interfere with that is preempted by the federal legislation.\n\nThe lawsuit also says Mr. Trump in an executive order on his first day in office declared that the country is \"facing an energy crisis\" and that energy production is a national security focus.\n\n\"If Michigan is permitted to pursue these sorts of state law claims, other States could pursue similar claims, leading to a chaotic 'patchwork' of regulations that undermine the national interest in readily available and affordable energy and the government's ability to effectively administer coherent national environmental policy and regulation of global pollution,\" the lawsuit filed in the Western District of Michigan read.\n\n\"Such fragmentation would frustrate Congress's intent for a unified federal approach to global air pollution,\" it continued.\n\nLocal outlets reported last year that the state of Michigan had contracted with three major law firms to bring the activist litigation against fossil fuel companies.\n\nThe planned lawsuit, according to the federal government, would interfere with foreign commerce, interstate gas emissions and national energy policy.\n\n\"The financial burdens of Michigan's anticipated lawsuit on fossil fuel businesses increase the United States' costs for purchasing fuels and threaten revenue from federal leasing,\" the complaint read. \"The United States seeks to protect citizens nationwide from higher energy costs and economic disruption caused by Michigan's anticipated overreach.\"\n\nThe Justice Department asked the courts to enjoin both states from filing such a lawsuit as unconstitutional.\n\nSimilarly, the feds filed a lawsuit against Hawaii in the District of Hawaii just two days after its governor announced they would be filing a case against big oil companies to get them to pay for damages he says were caused by climate change due to the fossil fuel industry.\n\n\"We will be filing suit, I believe, on Thursday against the fossil fuel companies. They have to pay their share because climate change and the climate impact is definitely connected to generations of extra fossil fuel that's been burned,\" Hawaii Gov. Josh Green said, according to local Fox affiliate KHON.\n\nHis office did not immediately respond to a request for comment about the Trump administration's lawsuit. A spokesperson from the Michigan attorney general's office also did not respond to a query from The Washington Times.\n\nThe city of Honolulu, along with California and other cities across the country, have launched climate change related claims against major fuel producers like Exxon and Chevron.\n\nWhile some of the efforts have been dismissed by judges, others are still working their way through the court system.\n\nThe Justice Department lawsuits say that over restrictive policies have caused a decrease in American energy development, creating a crisis. That led to the president signing the Protecting American Energy From State Overreach executive order on his first day in office and declaring a national energy crisis.\n\n\"As a result of state restrictions and burdens on energy production, the American people are paying more for energy, and the United States is less able to defend itself from hostile foreign actors,\" the federal government said in its litigation.",

Even the liberal Wisconsin Supreme Court issued an order suspending her from performing her judicial duties. The Milwaukee County Circuit Court judge is charged with two federal criminal offenses: one felony and one misdemeanor. The Supreme Court took away the argument that she was some kind of hero unfairly targeted by the Trump administration. Instead, she is a suspended judge facing serious federal charges.\n\nFBI agents arrested Judge Dugan last Friday. She was charged with two federal crimes: concealing a person from discovery and arrest and obstruction of federal government proceedings. Each charge stems from her alleged misdirection of federal agents from detaining Eduardo Flores-Ruiz.\n\nAccording to court documents, Mr. Flores-Ruiz was set to appear in court on April 18 for a pretrial conference for a case in which he was charged with several counts of battery and domestic abuse. FBI Director Kash Patel said on social media that authorities \"believe Judge Dugan intentionally misdirected federal agents away from the subject to be arrested in her courthouse, Eduardo Flores-Ruiz, allowing the subject -- an illegal alien -- to evade arrest. Thankfully our agents chased down the perp on foot and he's in custody since, but the Judge's obstruction created increased danger to the public.\"\n\nLiberals went wild but ignored the facts. Law enforcement officers often make arrests in courthouses for two obvious reasons: They can track when the suspect is in court, and most locations have security scanning so officers can take someone into custody without fear of the suspect hiding firearms. It just makes sense.\n\nLiberals also falsely suggest that the Trump administration is \"weaponizing law enforcement\" for its benefit. Besides the breathtaking list of ridiculous charges against President Trump, the more important point is that they do not dispute the facts laid out in the charges.\n\nJudge Hannah Dugan was not arrested for failing to cooperate with federal agents or going along with their actions. The charges against her are specifically for actions that led to obstruction of justice.\n\nIt is important to remember that a sworn magistrate in the federal courts reviewed the information and found probable cause before they brought charges against Judge Dugan. They had to make their case before they made an arrest.\n\nEduardo Flores-Ruiz was charged with counts of battery, domestic abuse, and infliction of physical pain or injury. A criminal complaint states he intentionally elbowed a woman, which caused her pain and bruising. He was also accused of punching his roommate 30 times with a closed fist. The girlfriend of the roommate tried to stop it, and Mr. Flores-Ruiz struck her with a closed fist and shoved her, according to the criminal complaint. He is also accused of grabbing his roommate by the neck -- a real role model.\n\nFederal agents were there to arrest him because Immigration and Customs Enforcement identified him as an illegal immigrant from Mexico, someone U.S. Border Patrol agents removed on Jan. 13, 2013, under the Obama administration. This is key because once someone has received an expedited removal order, the federal government can deport them without a court hearing.\n\nOn April 18, federal agents agreed to arrest Mr. Flores-Ruiz in the hallway outside the courtroom after the hearing. According to the FBI, the defense attorney told Judge Dugan that ICE was there to arrest Mr. Flores-Ruiz. The judge ordered him to sit in the jury box and stay there. Then, she went into the hallway to confront the ICE agents and demand that they leave the courthouse. After they presented her with an arrest warrant, she demanded that they see the chief judge.\n\nWhile the federal officers were waiting to see the chief judge, Judge Dugan returned to her courtroom and adjourned the hearing without talking to the prosecutor or the victims. Then, she took Mr. Flores-Ruiz and his attorney out through the jury door, and they left through a private hallway.\n\nFortunately for those of us who believe in the rule of law, a federal agent saw Mr. Flores-Ruiz trying to leave the courthouse and followed him. The agent called for backup. After a foot chase, the officers caught him. This put the agents and the general public at risk instead of the orderly process originally planned for taking him into custody outside the courtroom after the hearing.\n\nThese are the facts. I have yet to see any liberal apologist for suspended Judge Hannah Dugan dispute them. Instead, they try to use this as a platform to protest the policies of the Trump administration.\n\nSuspended Judge Dugan is a liberal activist. She ran against a well-qualified and respected incumbent because I appointed him. In a very liberal county, she won. Yet even in that county, the law applies to everyone -- even a judge.\n\nAccording to the charges, her actions obstructed justice. They prevented the arrest of a fugitive. She helped him leave the building in a way that would avoid arrest by federal agents. She put those officers and even the general public at risk by forcing them to make the arrest outside after a chase. She dismissed the interests of the victims in her courtroom. These are the facts she must now face in a federal courtroom.\n\nThe actions by the Wisconsin Supreme Court, ruled by a liberal majority, to suspend her authority to serve as a judge are just the beginning of her legal troubles. Others should take notice. No one is above the law.",

                "body": "The Spanish government boasted last month that it had become a global leader in fueling its economy with windmills and solar panels. Among leftists, there is no higher virtue to signal than replacing nuclear, gas and coal plants with these in-vogue alternatives.\n\nShortly after achieving this green energy miracle, Spain and Portugal's 60 million citizens were plunged into darkness not experienced since medieval times, when, not coincidentally, windmills were widely used as a power source. NASA satellite imagery captured the blackout stretching across the Iberian Peninsula.\n\nModern Europeans brag about the superiority of their electric train network, but some Spanish passengers may have entertained second thoughts when powerless locomotives left them stranded for hours. Even gasoline-fueled cars slowed without traffic lights to guide the chaos on the streets of Madrid, Barcelona and Lisbon.\n\nThose stuck in dark, high-rise elevators had no way to summon help when cellphone towers stopped transmitting. The public resorted to cash or barter to pay for what food or drink remained in markets swiftly emptied by panic buying.\n\nThe responsible authorities in Spain haven't been forthcoming about what caused the disruption. Ordinarily, \"renewable\" systems reliant on sun and wind power run out of juice on cloudy and windless days, but the situation here appears more complex. Portugal imports power from Spain, and its electric company, REN, said it had to disconnect when the Spanish network experienced a \"significant oscillation.\"\n\nUnder that theory, a glut of sunlight produced a surplus of solar electricity over a short period, introducing a dangerous imbalance into Spain's grid. Automated circuit breakers shut down everything to prevent a destructive surge from coursing through the entire system.\n\nCommon sense suggests that such things happen when one relies on volatile power sources dependent upon Mother Nature's whims. Many on the left would rather blame the catastrophe on climate change.\n\nThey're right to do so. Madrid's socialist government is obsessed with achieving \"net zero\" carbon dioxide emissions. That's why, in 2023, Spain ordered the decommissioning of all nuclear plants, with the final demolition scheduled in 2035.\n\n\"The renewable transformation in our country is now a reality,\" Spain's electricity provider recently bragged, adding it had \"successfully integrated over 98% of renewable generation at the peninsular level, a figure significantly higher than those recorded by neighbouring European countries.\"\n\nSpain didn't bother accounting for the downside of this strategy. \"When you hitch your wagon to the weather, it's just a risky endeavor,\" U.S. Energy Secretary Chris Wright observed on CNBC. \"Even in standard operating conditions, it's just driven up the price of energy so much in Europe.\"\n\nDespite the volatility and expense, Democrats on this side of the Atlantic want Uncle Sam to continue paying companies to set up wind turbines everywhere. These projects are somehow an act of \"environmental justice\" even though their merciless blades slice through thousands of eagles, hawks and condors every year.\n\nInvestors also saturate once-pristine landscapes with massive solar arrays, hoping to turn those environmental subsidies into big profits. Thanks to November's election results, however, this madness is ending. President Trump has canceled permits for offshore windmill installations.\n\nThe Interior Department has ordered Empire Offshore Wind to halt construction on a massive project for the New York Power Authority and Consolidated Edison. Manhattan liberals, like Spain, were gung-ho about doing whatever it took to increase their renewable bragging rights.",
