            "body": "The impact of young voters on the election will become clear after polling day on May 3.\n\nThey're disillusioned, resentful and many suspect the system is rigged against them.\n\nFor the first time, Gen Z and millennial voters outnumber baby boomers at the federal election -- and most of them aren't reaching the same milestones as their parents.\n\nMore than 7 million Australians have already cast their vote ahead of Saturday, and despite a campaign largely shaped by the rising cost of living and housing, it's unclear whether young voters feel satisfied by what's on offer.\n\nPolitical analysts say their grievances could deliver unexpected results in marginal seats.\n\nA widening wealth gap\n\nPaul Strangio, emeritus professor in politics at Monash University, said generational inequality could be driving \"unpredictable\" voting patterns among Gen Zs and millennials.\n\n\"They're not reaching the sort of milestones that previous generations did, such as home ownership, marrying [and] having children,\" Dr Strangio said.\n\n\"Those things used to predispose people to becoming more conservative in their outlook.\"\n\nAustralia's birth rate recently hit an all-time low, and government data shows today's 30-34 year-olds are the first age group in more than 47 years where most people don't own a house.\n\nUNSW economics professor Richard Holden said while many young voters earn higher incomes today than their parents did at their age, it was now much harder to build wealth through property ownership.\n\n\"I'm not sure there's rising intergenerational income inequality, but there's a good case to worry about wealth inequality,\" he said.\n\n\"And I'd say that aspect is getting worse.\"\n\nTim Harcourt, an economist at the University of Technology Sydney, agreed the wealth disparity between generations was becoming increasingly acute.\n\n\"It's really starting to bite now as the Baby Boomers retire into their defined benefits superannuation schemes and extra properties,\" he said.\n\n\"I think housing is a red button issue ... and that's where the youth reaction will be really important.\"\n\nYoung voters 'a ticking time bomb'\n\nDr Strangio said voters typically became more conservative as they grew older, but now they're skewing further to the left and feeling increasingly dissatisfied with the major parties.\n\n\"Young voters are a ticking time bomb,\" he said.\n\n\"They're facing real wage declines, high costs for education, difficulty in getting into the housing market and yet so far I think they've been quiet tolerant.\"\n\nBut he warned their patience wouldn't last forever.\n\n\"When we look overseas to places like Trump's America, young men are being attracted to aggressive, populist policies because of inequalities,\" he said.\n\n\"I think it's a warning that we do need to address those things with some urgency because we don't want to see those sorts of trends.\"\n\nProfessor Harcourt said while the youth vote typically skewed to the left in inner-city electorates, voting patterns would be harder to predict among tradies or factory workers in rural areas.\n\n\"It's quite unpredictable in the outer suburbs where there's housing stress and population stress, where there is a view that the infrastructure is not keeping up with the population growth,\" he said.\n\nClimate change remains a concern\n\nAside from housing affordability and the cost of living, a new YouGov poll suggests young voters remain deeply concerned about the impacts of climate change.\n\nEarlier this year, Australians' social media accounts lit up with videos of wildfires ripping through Los Angeles and damage from Tropical Cyclone Alfred in parts of Queensland and New South Wales.\n\nAccording to the YouGov poll, four-in-five young voters said climate change would influence their vote in the federal election.\n\nThe poll of 1,622 adult Australian voters, commissioned by Solutions for Climate Australia, found 79 per cent of Gen Zs and 73 per cent of millennials said climate change was an important part of their decision-making at the polling booth.\n\nAbout 67 per cent of undecided voters also said climate change was important in determining their vote.\n\nAustralian Youth Climate Coalition national director Grace Vegesana said the issue wasn't going away.\n\n\"Young people under 40 do deeply care about the climate crisis and if they're not seeing solutions ... they will vote accordingly.\"\n\nShe said many young voters reported feeling left behind this election.\n\n\"We are going to see a shift away from the major parties as people realise [we] want to see ambition, and not just be handed baseline policies that continue business as usual,\" she said.",

            "title": "Your guide to major parties' key policies",
            "body": "Australians across the nation are set to head to the polling booths to decide who will lead the nation for the next three years.\n\nThroughout a rapid election campaign period, the parties have revealed (and sometimes rolled back) their policies on key issues such as health, the cost of living, housing, energy, defence, migration, crime and Indigenous affairs.\n\nTo help you decide who gets your vote, we've compiled a quick guide outlining the major policies on key issues from Labor, the Coalition and the Greens.\n\nHealth\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Albanese government's flagship campaign promise was $8.5bn to deliver an additional 18 million bulk-billed GP visits each year if re-elected. The Labor government also pledged a cap of $25 per prescription for medicines covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Both of these policies were matched by the Coalition. The Coalition will also match Labor's $575m plan to add oral contraceptives, menopause hormone therapies, endometriosis and IVF drugs to the PBS.\n\nLabor: In addition to the above policies, Labor pledged a $1bn boost for headspace clinics and specialist centres for youth, $644m for 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, and $16.7m to bolster mental health support services for new parents.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has promised a $5m review of women-specific items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS, $500m to raise Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20, $400m for youth mental health and a $15m boost to the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund.\n\nGreens: The Greens also support an expansion of Medicare but at a far greater level. They have pledged $195bn to Medicare to expand the system to include dental and extended mental health support.\n\nCost of living\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Coalition has backed Labor's position to freeze the alcohol excise on draught beer for two years, starting from August 1, 2025. Both parties have also agreed to extend energy bill rebates for all households until the end of 2025, saving $150 per household at a cost of $1.8bn.\n\nLabor: Effective from June 1, 2025, the Labor government will implement a 20 per cent reduction on all student loan debts, including HELP, VET Student Loans and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans. A re-elected Labor government would introduce an instant $1000 tax deduction for work-related expenses, and tax breaks announced during the federal budget for those in the lowest bracket would be made permanent.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged a one-time tax offset of up to $1200 for workers earning up to $144,000. If elected, the Coalition would cut the fuel excise in half for 12 months starting in July, but it would repeal the changes that give people in the lowest bracket a tax break.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to make all public transport cost 50c, wipe all student debt and provide universal mental health care with unlimited sessions.\n\nHousing\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both have promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from buying existing homes for two years and have ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\nLabor: Labor will expand its Homes for Australia plan to build an extra 100,000 homes specifically for first-time buyers, and all first-home buyers will be eligible for 5 per cent deposits.\n\nCoalition: TheCoalition will allow first-home buyers to take 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to $50,000, for a home deposit. First-home buyers of new properties will be able to claim the interest paid on the first $650,000 of a mortgage as a tax deduction. The Coalition has also vowed to maintain the Home Guarantee Scheme program, which includes a 5 per cent deposit program for first-homebuyers, and a 2 per cent deposit scheme for single parents or eligible single legal guardians with at least one dependent.\n\nGreens: The Greens will phase out tax handouts for property investors with more than one investment property by scrapping the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. They also pledge to limit rent increases to 2 per cent every two years.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both Labor and the Coalition have committed to a $10m investment in a new Bureau of Meteorology weather radar for regional Queensland.\n\nLabor: Labor will slash the cost of solar battery installations by up to $4000 per household from July 1 and extend the energy bill rebate until the end of the year, saving households $150. Labor will also aim to source 82 per cent of the electricity grid from renewables by 2030.\n\nCoalition: One of the Liberal Party's flagship policies is its nuclear plan. A Coalition government will build seven government-owned nuclear reactors co-located alongside retiring coal-fired generators by 2050, with the first two smaller generators in operation by 2035. Under a Coalition government, the energy mix will be 54 per cent renewables, 33 per cent nuclear, with the remaining 13 per cent battery storage and gas.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to block all new coal and gas projects. The Greens' climate and energy plan includes expanding the Net Zero Economy Authority to support all fossil fuel workers and invest $10bn in clean industries and infrastructure in transitioning regions.\n\nDefence\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have pledged to regain ownership of the Port of Darwin.\n\nLabor: Labor has pledged at least $50.3bn into defence over the next decade, with Anthony Albanese leaving the door open to further increases. An additional $262m has been allocated to bolster local defence industries and develop Australia's nuclear-powered submarine supply chain under the AUKUS partnership.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition's flagship defence policy is a $21bn boost to the defence budget over the next five years, pushing total military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The Coalition has pledged to speed up the AUKUS submarine agreement, though it has not detailed how.\n\nThe Greens: The Greens have pledged to withdraw from the AUKUS political pact and renegotiate Australia's position in the ANZUS treaty. As a result, the Greens would attempt to stop the $375bn purchase of AUKUS nuclear submarines.\n\nMigration\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have announced they will increase the cost of student visa applications. The Coalition pledged to triple the cost of student visa applications to $5000 (up from $1600), while a re-elected Labor government would increase the cost of student visa applications to $2000.\n\nLabor: Labor has been relatively silent on the issue of migration but canned the Coalition's policies as \"savage\".\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged to reduce the permanent migration intake by 25 per cent. The cuts would target those on skilled visas in an effort to lower permanent migration from 185,000 in 2024-25 to 140,000 in 2025-26. Mr Dutton has also said the party would slash the number of international students by 80,000. The Coalition has also made a commitment to reduce the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.\n\nGreens: The Greens want to expand Australia's humanitarian intake to 50,000 places per year and create additional places via a new private humanitarian sponsorship program.\n\nCrime\n\nLabor: Labor has promised $157m over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco and $8.6m \u00ef\"\u00bfin funding for management of domestic violence perpetrators. It has pledged to take steps to prevent domestic violence perpetrators from using the tax and corporate systems to create debts as a form of coercive control.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition announced a $750m package to tackle crime across the nation. Dubbed \"Operation Safer Communities\", the Opposition Leader's plan would implement a national drug strike team and a 12-month pilot of a National Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme. The Coalition has also pledged $90m to tackle domestic violence, including implementing a National Domestic Violence Register to ensure police and relevant agencies can share information about violent offenders.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to fund the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children with $12n over 12 years. They have also earmarked $3.3m for a national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to help people who may be at risk of domestic violence to find out if their current or former partner has a history of violent criminal offences.\n\nIndigenous affairs\n\nLabor: Labor has broadly committed to a continuation of efforts to close the gap. It has promised an extra $5mn towards pre-existing plans for a TAFE Centre of Excellence with hubs in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and $77m towards sea wall and wastewater infrastructure in the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has vowed to establish a royal commission into allegations of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities and reintroduce compulsory income management via the Cashless Debit Card.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged $250 to establish a National Truth and Justice Commission to acknowledge and document historic and ongoing injustices. They will also introduce a federal Act to protect First Nations cultural heritage.",

            "title": "Dozens of homeless people living in national forest evicted by US Forest Service",
            "body": "Service closing area in Oregon for wildfire prevention plan months after Trump order to increase timber production\n\nDozens of homeless people who have been living in a national forest in central Oregon for years were being evicted on Thursday by the US Forest Service, as it closed the area for a wildfire prevention project that will involve removing smaller trees, clearing debris and setting controlled burns over thousands of acres.\n\nThe project has been on the books for years, and the decision to remove the encampment in the Deschutes national forest comes two months after the Trump administration issued an executive order directing federal agencies to increase timber production and forest management projects aimed at reducing wildfire risk. It wasn't immediately clear if the evictions were a result of that order, but homeless advocates seized on the timing on Thursday, as US Forest Service officers blocked the access road.\n\n\"The fact that they are doing this with such vigor shortly after they announced that the forests would be opened up for logging I don't think is a coincidence,\" said Jesse Rabinowitz, a spokesperson for the National Homelessness Law Center.\n\nThe US Department of Agriculture, which oversees the US Forest Service, and the service's Pacific Northwest Region did not immediately respond to emailed requests for comment.\n\n\"The closure does not target any specific user group and will restrict all access, including day use and overnight camping, while crews operate heavy machinery, conduct prescribed burns, and clean up hazardous materials,\" Deschutes national forest spokesperson Kaitlyn Webb said in an email. \"It's not safe for the public to be in the area while heavy machinery is operating, trees are being felled, mowing operations are active, and prescribed burning is occurring.\"\n\nCampers who had set up trailers, recreational vehicles and tents amidst the ponderosa pines in the Deschutes national forest scrambled in the darkness Wednesday night to pack up and get their engines working again. Authorities closed the two-lane road in the early hours of Thursday morning, and it was not immediately clear how many people were left in the forest by the afternoon, though some were unable to leave.\n\nThe US Forest Service has been working for years on plans to close part of the Deschutes national forest near Bend for forest restoration and wildfire mitigation. But the number of people living in that part of the forest has grown, with many losing homes during the coronavirus pandemic due to job losses and high housing costs, Rabinowitz said.\n\nDonald Trump's administration has acted to roll back environmental safeguards around future logging projects on more than half of US national forests, under an emergency designation that cites dangers from wildfires.\n\nWhether the administration's move will boost lumber supplies as Trump envisioned in an executive order he signed in March remains to be seen. Joe Biden's administration also sought more logging in public forests to combat fires, which have become more intense amid drier and hotter conditions linked to the climate crisis, yet US Forest Service timber sales stayed relatively flat under his tenure.\n\nThe Cabin Butte Vegetation Management Project, a wildfire mitigation treatment on some 30,000 acres (12,000 hectares), is prompting the closures in the Deschutes national forest.\n\nThe goal of the work is to reduce wildfire risk and restore damaged habitats where development encroaches on natural areas near Bend, Deschutes national forest officials said in a statement. Recreation sites and trails in that area will be closed through April next year.\n\nMultiple US Forest Service officials and vehicles were stationed at the Deschutes national forest road closure on Thursday. A sign on the metal gate blocking the road said the temporary emergency closure will last at least one year.\n\nViolators could face up six months in jail, fines up to $5,000, or both.\n\nOn Wednesday night, Mandy Bryant, who said she had lived in the encampment for about three years, was cleaning up her site and trying to get a trailer to start so she could move it.\n\n\"You could feel the heaviness in the air and just the stress and depression that people are feeling,\" she told the Associated Press. \"We're up there on the list of groups of people that society doesn't really care for.\"\n\nFour people living in the encampment including Bryant, along with two homeless advocates, filed for a restraining order to stop the closure earlier this month. The claim argued it would cause irreparable harm to more than 100 people who were living there, many of whom have disabilities.\n\nThe government responded in court filings that US Forest Service staff in January began notifying homeless people living in the area of the upcoming closure. Original plans for the project were published in 2019 and were authorized by the US Forest Service in 2023, the court filings said.\n\nUS district court judge Michael McShane denied the restraining order on Tuesday and issued a written opinion on Thursday.\n\n\"The public's significant interest in restoring natural habitats, preventing catastrophic wildfires, and preserving the overall health of Deschutes National Forest is not outweighed by the interest of 150 or so individuals in residing on this particular plot of land,\" he wrote in his ruling.\n\nWebb, a Deschutes national forest spokesperson, told the Oregonian/OregonLive that the government's goal is \"voluntary compliance\", but Forest Service officers and staff will patrol and \"enforce the closure and ensure public safety\".",

            "body": "Where Labor, Coalition and Greens stand on key issuesGeorgie Kibel, Blair Jackson, Jessica WangNewsWireFri, 2 May 2025 7:02AM\n\nAustralians across the nation are set to head to the polling booths to decide who will lead the nation for the next three years.\n\nThroughout a rapid election campaign period, the parties have revealed (and sometimes rolled back) their policies on key issues such as health, the cost of living, housing, energy, defence, migration, crime and Indigenous affairs.\n\nTo help you decide who gets your vote, we've compiled a quick guide outlining the major policies on key issues from Labor, the Coalition and the Greens.\n\nHealth\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Albanese government's flagship campaign promise was $8.5bn to deliver an additional 18 million bulk-billed GP visits each year if re-elected. The Labor government also pledged a cap of $25 per prescription for medicines covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (PBS). Both of these policies were matched by the Coalition. The Coalition will also match Labor's $575m plan to add oral contraceptives, menopause hormone therapies, endometriosis and IVF drugs to the PBS.\n\nFeel like giving the politicians a rating this Federal election?\n\nOur Pollie Rater lets you do just that.\n\nRate the politicians\n\nLabor: In addition to the above policies, Labor pledged a $1bn boost for headspace clinics and specialist centres for youth, $644m for 50 Medicare Urgent Care Clinics, and $16.7m to bolster mental health support services for new parents.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has promised a $5m review of women-specific items listed on the Medicare Benefits Schedule and PBS, $500m to raise Medicare-subsidised mental health sessions from 10 to 20, $400m for youth mental health and a $15m boost to the National Suicide Prevention Research Fund.\n\nGreens: The Greens also support an expansion of Medicare but at a far greater level. They have pledged $195bn to Medicare to expand the system to include dental and extended mental health support.\n\nCost of living\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: The Coalition has backed Labor's position to freeze the alcohol excise on draught beer for two years, starting from August 1, 2025. Both parties have also agreed to extend energy bill rebates for all households until the end of 2025, saving $150 per household at a cost of $1.8bn.\n\nLabor: Effective from June 1, 2025, the Labor government will implement a 20 per cent reduction on all student loan debts, including HELP, VET Student Loans and Australian Apprenticeship Support Loans. A re-elected Labor government would introduce an instant $1000 tax deduction for work-related expenses, and tax breaks announced during the federal budget for those in the lowest bracket would be made permanent.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged a one-time tax offset of up to $1200 for workers earning up to $144,000. If elected, the Coalition would cut the fuel excise in half for 12 months starting in July, but it would repeal the changes that give people in the lowest bracket a tax break.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to make all public transport cost 50c, wipe all student debt and provide universal mental health care with unlimited sessions.\n\nHousing\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both have promised to ban foreign investors and temporary residents from buying existing homes for two years and have ruled out changes to negative gearing and capital gains tax.\n\nLabor: Labor will expand its Homes for Australia plan to build an extra 100,000 homes specifically for first-time buyers, and all first-home buyers will be eligible for 5 per cent deposits.\n\nCoalition: TheCoalition will allow first-home buyers to take 40 per cent of their superannuation, up to $50,000, for a home deposit. First-home buyers of new properties will be able to claim the interest paid on the first $650,000 of a mortgage as a tax deduction. The Coalition has also vowed to maintain the Home Guarantee Scheme program, which includes a 5 per cent deposit program for first-homebuyers, and a 2 per cent deposit scheme for single parents or eligible single legal guardians with at least one dependent.\n\nGreens: The Greens will phase out tax handouts for property investors with more than one investment property by scrapping the negative gearing and the capital gains tax discount. They also pledge to limit rent increases to 2 per cent every two years.\n\nEnergy\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both Labor and the Coalition have committed to a $10m investment in a new Bureau of Meteorology weather radar for regional Queensland.\n\nLabor: Labor will slash the cost of solar battery installations by up to $4000 per household from July 1 and extend the energy bill rebate until the end of the year, saving households $150. Labor will also aim to source 82 per cent of the electricity grid from renewables by 2030.\n\nCoalition: One of the Liberal Party's flagship policies is its nuclear plan. A Coalition government will build seven government-owned nuclear reactors co-located alongside retiring coal-fired generators by 2050, with the first two smaller generators in operation by 2035. Under a Coalition government, the energy mix will be 54 per cent renewables, 33 per cent nuclear, with the remaining 13 per cent battery storage and gas.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to block all new coal and gas projects. The Greens' climate and energy plan includes expanding the Net Zero Economy Authority to support all fossil fuel workers and invest $10bn in clean industries and infrastructure in transitioning regions.\n\nDefence\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have pledged to regain ownership of the Port of Darwin.\n\nLabor: Labor has pledged at least $50.3bn into defence over the next decade, with Anthony Albanese leaving the door open to further increases. An additional $262m has been allocated to bolster local defence industries and develop Australia's nuclear-powered submarine supply chain under the AUKUS partnership.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition's flagship defence policy is a $21bn boost to the defence budget over the next five years, pushing total military spending to 2.5 per cent of GDP. The Coalition has pledged to speed up the AUKUS submarine agreement, though it has not detailed how.\n\nThe Greens: The Greens have pledged to withdraw from the AUKUS political pact and renegotiate Australia's position in the ANZUS treaty. As a result, the Greens would attempt to stop the $375bn purchase of AUKUS nuclear submarines.\n\nMigration\n\nWhat the major parties agree on: Both parties have announced they will increase the cost of student visa applications. The Coalition pledged to triple the cost of student visa applications to $5000 (up from $1600), while a re-elected Labor government would increase the cost of student visa applications to $2000.\n\nLabor: Labor has been relatively silent on the issue of migration but canned the Coalition's policies as \"savage\".\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has pledged to reduce the permanent migration intake by 25 per cent. The cuts would target those on skilled visas in an effort to lower permanent migration from 185,000 in 2024-25 to 140,000 in 2025-26. Mr Dutton has also said the party would slash the number of international students by 80,000. The Coalition has also made a commitment to reduce the humanitarian intake from 20,000 to 13,750 per year.\n\nGreens: The Greens want to expand Australia's humanitarian intake to 50,000 places per year and create additional places via a new private humanitarian sponsorship program.\n\nCrime\n\nLabor: Labor has promised $157m over two years to crack down on the trade of illicit tobacco and $8.6m in funding for management of domestic violence perpetrators. It has pledged to take steps to prevent domestic violence perpetrators from using the tax and corporate systems to create debts as a form of coercive control.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition announced a $750m package to tackle crime across the nation. Dubbed \"Operation Safer Communities\", the Opposition Leader's plan would implement a national drug strike team and a 12-month pilot of a National Child Sex Offender Disclosure Scheme. The Coalition has also pledged $90m to tackle domestic violence, including implementing a National Domestic Violence Register to ensure police and relevant agencies can share information about violent offenders.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged to fund the National Plan to End Violence Against Women and Children with $12n over 12 years. They have also earmarked $3.3m for a national Domestic Violence Disclosure Scheme to help people who may be at risk of domestic violence to find out if their current or former partner has a history of violent criminal offences.\n\nIndigenous affairs\n\nLabor: Labor has broadly committed to a continuation of efforts to close the gap. It has promised an extra $5mn towards pre-existing plans for a TAFE Centre of Excellence with hubs in Alice Springs and Tennant Creek and $77m towards sea wall and wastewater infrastructure in the Torres Strait Islands.\n\nCoalition: The Coalition has vowed to establish a royal commission into allegations of child sexual abuse in Indigenous communities and reintroduce compulsory income management via the Cashless Debit Card.\n\nGreens: The Greens have pledged $250 to establish a National Truth and Justice Commission to acknowledge and document historic and ongoing injustices. They will also introduce a federal Act to protect First Nations cultural heritage.\n\nOriginally published as Where Labor, Coalition and Greens stand on key issues\n\nGet the latest news from thewest.com.au in your inbox.\n\nSign up for our emails",

            "title": "South Korean Presidential Frontrunner Potentially Disqualified by Court Ruling",
            "body": "Lee Jae-myung, the front-running candidate in South Korea's special presidential election, may have been disqualified by a ruling from the Supreme Court on Thursday.\n\nLee, the leader of the left-wing Democratic Party of Korea (DP), has been leading in the polls ever since President Yoon Suk-yeol of the conservative People Power Party (PPP) was impeached in December. Yoon was impeached for declaring martial law in December, ostensibly to combat \"subversive anti-state elements.\"\n\nSouth Korea's Constitutional Court formally removed Yoon from office on April 4, paving the way for a special election to replace him on June 3. The interim president who managed the office for most of the time since Yoon's impeachment, Han Duck-soo, resigned his position on Thursday and is expected to enter the race as a candidate.\n\n\"I have two paths ahead of me. One is completing the heavy responsibility that I handle now. The other is putting down that responsibility and taking a heavier responsibility. I've finally determined to put down my post to do what I can and what I have to help overcome the crises facing us,\" Han said on Thursday, strongly suggesting he has an eye on the upcoming election.\n\nHan's resignation would have bumped Minister of Economy and Finance Choi Sang-mok into the acting presidential hot seat -- except the opposition immediately filed a motion to impeach Choi, and he resigned from his office within a matter of hours.\n\nPPP lawmakers stormed out of the assembly hall to protest the impeachment vote against Choi, who has already been acting president once before, when the opposition impeached Han Duck-soo in December. The Supreme Court overturned that impeachment and reinstalled Han as the acting president in March.\n\nLee Jae-myung, who ran for president in 2022 and narrowly lost to Yoon, announced his intention to run again on April 10. He said income inequality and economic growth would be his top priorities.\n\n\"Our economy is in dire straits. The government's role is important, but for the past three years, the government has neglected the economy,\" he said when declaring his candidacy.\n\nThe DP formally nominated Lee as its candidate on Tuesday, giving him almost 90% of its votes. According to the most recent polls he is running far ahead of potential challenges with 38% support from the public. No other candidate is polling above 10% at the moment, although the conservative vote may coalesce around a single candidate when the PPP nominates its candidate next weekend.\n\n\"Now, the people and our party colleagues gave me an opportunity to win back the presidency and build a new, real Republic of Korea. Thank you! I'll humbly uphold that ardent,\" Lee said in his acceptance speech.\n\nUnfortunately for Lee, the Supreme Court might have bounced him out of the race on Thursday by overturning a previous ruling that cleared him of charges that he made \"false statements\" during his 2022 race against Yoon.\n\nLee is under investigation for several charges that would seem fairly serious, including corruption allegations linked to a real-estate scandal from his days as governor of Gyeonggi province, but the election law case was always seen as the one that might sink him, because he has already been found guilty and sentenced to a year in prison for it.\n\nLee was accused of making false statements on two occasions in 2021. In the first instance, he claimed he was coerced by the national Ministry of Land, Infrastructure, and Transport into rezoning some property to benefit a major development project while he was mayor of the city of Seongnam.\n\nLee's critics believe he made the controversial rezoning decision for his own personal financial benefit. The Land Ministry said Lee's story of coercion was false, and the ministry's position would ultimately be accepted by the Supreme Court.\n\nThe other allegedly false statement was made in December 2021, when Lee denied his links to the massive Seongnam real estate scandal. The court found Lee's denials were demonstrably false and intended to manipulate voters.\n\nThe Seoul Central District Court found Lee guilty on both charges of making false statements in November 2024 and sentenced him to a year in prison. The sentence was suspended, but under South Korean law, the verdict was enough to disqualify him from running for office for at least five years.\n\nThe Seoul High Court overturned the Central District Court's ruling in March, clearing the way for Lee to run in the June presidential election. Prosecutors appealed to the Supreme Court, and on Thursday they won their case, as the Supreme Court overturned the High Court's ruling.\n\nChief Justice Jo Hee-de said on Thursday that Lee's statements in October and December 2021 were \"judged to be false statements on matters important enough to ruin voters' accurate judgement on the defendant's eligibility for public office.\"\n\nLee might have one more chance to stay in the race, as the Supreme Court tossed his case back down to the appellate court level for a new ruling. The Supreme Court moved very quickly to hear Lee's case, but the appeals court could take months before issuing a new ruling.\n\nIronically, the four serious corruption cases against Lee -- the very charges he was convicted of making false statements about in 2021 -- probably will not reach the courts until long after the June election, so they are not seen as serious impediments to his run.\n\nThere was a good deal of confusion among politicians, commentators, and legal experts in South Korea on Thursday over whether Lee can continue running for president after the Supreme Court ruling.\n\nPolitical consultant Park Sung-min told Nikkei Asia on Thursday that Lee can legally continue his campaign, and he probably will, but he probably shouldn't. If the appeals court moves as quickly as the Supreme Court did, a ruling could be dropped right in the middle of the campaign that forces Lee to suspend his candidacy.\n\n\"Lee will face pressure to resign as the court allows time for a change of candidate, but I think the Democratic Party will go ahead with him,\" Park predicted.\n\nThe DP held an emergency meeting on Thursday to discuss Lee's fate, and decided it would stick with him. The party criticized the Supreme Court ruling and said it has no plans to name an alternative candidate.\n\nPolitical analyst Rhee Jong-hoon told Reuters that whatever the DP might be saying in public, it will almost certainly discuss a \"Plan B\" behind closed doors, possibly including an outreach to minor parties to form a coalition around a different candidate.\n\n\"The appeals court will decide whether to disqualify him to run for office or not, but the Supreme Court in effect found him guilty,\" noted Myongji University political science professor Shin Yul. \"Moderate voters, 10% of the total, will be swayed by this news.\"\n\nLee himself seemingly argued that the election should be the ultimate verdict on his actions, rendered by the South Korean people.\n\n\"It was a totally different direction of ruling from what I thought,\" he said of the Supreme Court decision. \"Law is a consensus of people, and people's will matters the most.\"",

            "title": "Adams' $115B 'Best Budget Ever' is chocked full of freebies fit for...",
            "body": "Mayor Eric Adams served up a $115 billion election year spending plan Thursday that's stuffed with voter-pleasing goodies, but that was still slammed by critics for squirreling away relatively little for a rainy day.\n\nHizzoner, who faces an uphill re-election battle, unveiled his 2026 executive budget during a campaign-like event from his alma mater Bayside High School in Queens, rather than City Hall, from which such announcements have traditionally been done.\n\n\"This is not a budget that favors the few. It is budget for all of you,\" Adams said, while flanked by students. \"In fact, it is no exaggeration to say that our fiscal Year 2026 executive budget is the best budget ever.\"\n\nThe budget lavishes $1.4 billion on programs and services that had faced cuts -- such as libraries, early child education and the City University of New York.\n\nIt also launches a universal after-school program and increases education funding by $376 million.\n\nThe spending plan is the largest Adams has proposed since taking office in 2022, with last year's executive budget proposal coming in at $111.6 billion.\n\n\"Welcome to the election year!\" said veteran campaign strategist Hank Sheinkopf, adding that incumbent mayors usually throw caution to the wind when seeking a second term.\n\n\"An election year means living in the moment. Tomorrow, next year is a long time away,\" Sheinkopf told The Post. \"It's 'spend whatever we can now.' It's like a bank robbery.\"\n\nCritics quickly pounced on Adams seemingly failing to plan for the possibility of tough economic times in the near future, from President Trump's tariffs, a widely anticipated upcoming recession and potential federal funding cuts.\n\n\"Despite being flush with cash, Mayor Eric Adams' Fiscal Year 2026 Executive Budget fails to address the dual threats of looming federal budget cuts and a possible recession,\" said Andrew Rein, president of the nonpartisan fiscal watchdog group Citizens Budget Commission.\n\n\"Instead of wisely adding $1 billion in next year's General Reserve to soften the first blows of federal cuts and $2 billion to the Rainy Day Fund, the budget increases spending to an unaffordable level.\"\n\nRein said the city should have between $8 and $10 billion in reserves for potential choppy economic waters -- a sum that city budget Director Jacques Jiha agreed would be needed, if the Big Apple were in a \"doomsday\" scenario.\n\n\"We're not looking at doomsday, we're looking at a slowdown in the economy,\" he said.\n\n\"We believe we have adequate reserves.\"\n\nAdams' preliminary budget, released in January, was blasted by opponents, including in the progressive City Council, for needlessly cutting services.\n\nBut his administration maintained those slashes were necessary due to skyrocketing costs from the migrant crisis -- which Jiha said has now cost the city more than $7 billion.\n\nThe mayor had begged Albany lawmakers in February for $1.1 billion to deal with the migrant crisis, contending then that the city needed it in 12 weeks.\n\nCity Hall officials offered nary a peep about the ask since then -- and the supposed shortfall apparently has been covered by savings, with Jiha saying only \"Money is fungible\" as an explanation.\n\nThe budget announced Thursday is Adams' first since the crisis largely subsided, and includes these spending increases and reversed cuts:\n\n\"Adams is using this budget to promote his re-election. He doesn't want to have much of a fight with the council,\" said Nicole Gelinas, senior fellow at the conservative think tank the Manhattan Institute.\n\n\"It's pre-emptive capitulation to the council,\" she added, noting Adams was proposing $1.7 billion more in spending compared to his preliminary budget.\n\n\"Adams is blowing out the agency spending,\" Gelinas said. \"[He] is squandering the last of his budget credibility.\"\n\nNot all programs and departments saw a funding increase. The following budget cuts were included in the plan:\n\nTalks with City Council Speaker Adrienne Adams, who is not related to Hizzoner and is running for the Democratic mayoral nomination, will continue until the June 30 deadline to pass the budget.\n\nAdams' plan offered plenty of fodder from candidates hoping to boot him from Gracie Mansion, such as City Comptroller Brad Lander -- who claimed the mayor was \"failing to protect New Yorkers\" by not putting more cash in reserves.\n\nFormer city comptroller and current mayoral candidate Scott Stringer also blasted Adams for failing to prepare for a potential \"extraordinary loss of funding for New York City.\"\n\nAdrienne Adams offered less gloom and doom -- though she still cautioned against getting too comfortable.\n\n\"I think that the budget right now is good, but we can never be too certain about what is coming around the corner with this Trump administration,\" she said.\n\nAdams, who boasted of confronting then-President Joe Biden for migrant funding, hasn't been nearly as vocal about his growing ally Trump.\n\nHe said he hasn't been in contact with the White House, even as he acknowledged that the current global climate was creating \"uncharted waters.\"\n\nAdams' top deputy, however, was quick to put a positive spin on the potential financial woes.\n\n\"We are best positioned to address with Washington those issues going forward,\" said First Deputy Mayor Randy Mastro. \"Even asking a question about a doomsday scenario is to be with those pessimistic and political opportunists who don't bet on New York, who are saying, 'The sky is falling.'",

            "body": "Warning: This story contains an image of a Nazi symbol.\n\nThousands of campaign posters -- cable-tied to fences and lining the streets -- each emblazoned with a candidate's name and portrait.\n\nAnd while stealing or vandalising corflutes isn't new, political experts are warning dirty tactics are becoming more common in some tight electorates.\n\nElection signs have been marked with swastikas or offensive slurs, burned, vandalised, smeared with excrement, stomped on and shredded, especially in marginal seats.\n\nPolitics lecturer Dr Blair Williams from Monash University said the high volume of reports, and their severity, was worrying.\n\n\"Much of what we're seeing on corflutes kind of relates to that increased polarisation, increased normalisation of hate speech,\" she said.\n\n\"It's not surprising that we're seeing that trickle down into politics on the streets.\"\n\nSome vandals caught on camera\n\nIn the marginal seat of Mackellar in Sydney's north, independent MP Sophie Scamps said about 500 of her electoral signs had been \"slashed and destroyed\" over the past month.\n\nPictures circulating on social media show a man appearing to take down a number of Ms Scamps's posters and using a knife to shred them.\n\n\"People find such aggression at best puerile, at worst deeply threatening,\" Ms Scamps said.\n\n\"The electorate has been covered in bright yellow, denigrating and misleading posters and ads about me. After the actions of Professor Malham in Kooyong have illustrated, I'm not sure we can say this is just healthy democracy.\"\n\nMs Scamps was referring to Melbourne neurosurgeon, Professor Greg Malham, after a video circulated of a man tearing down a poster of independent MP Monique Ryan in the marginal Melbourne seat of Kooyong.\n\nNine Newspapers reported Professor Malham admitted to being the man in the video and apologised.\n\nMs Ryan told the ABC the video was \"deeply concerning\" but was far from an isolated incident.\n\n\"We've seen groups from both within and outside Kooyong stoking division through aggressively negative advertising,\" she said.\n\n\"It's creating a climate of hostility that is distressing to candidates, volunteers, and the broader community.\"\n\n\"There's no place in Australian electoral campaigns or society for violence and aggression.\"\n\nMs Ryan said more than 200 of her corflutes had been torn down and defaced, sometimes with very distressing messages or symbols put on them.\n\n\"It's been a really tough election campaign nationally, things are heightened, and there's a lot of tension,\" she said.\n\nMs Ryan herself copped criticism earlier in the campaign, after her husband was caught on video removing a sign of her Liberal opponent Amelia Hamer.\n\nPeter Jordan apologised for the incident, saying he believed the sign was illegally placed.\n\n'Violent' vandalism and incidents of physical assault\n\nSome attacks on signage have also turned physically violent.\n\nIn Ashfield in Sydney's inner west, a 79-year-old man was taken to hospital in a serious condition after an alleged assault outside a polling booth in Prime Minister Anthony Albanese's electorate of Grayndler.\n\nThe ABC understands the elderly man was confronted after defacing one of Mr Albanese's corflutes. A 17-year-old boy has been charged over the incident.\n\nElsewhere in Sydney, in the seat of Bennelong, a 30-year-old man was charged with intimidation after kicking a number of signs and allegedly becoming aggressive towards volunteers at the booth.\n\nA number of police investigations have been conducted in the hotly-contested seat of Calare in the New South Wales Central West, where the Nationals are hoping to win against sitting independent Andrew Gee.\n\nIn a statement, Detective Inspector Jason Darcy said there had been examples of malicious damage and people being abusive to others at a number of polling centres across NSW \"due to heightened emotions ahead of the federal election\".\n\n\"The message is clear -- this is not what police want to see and there will be no tolerance for any behaviour that could harm others at any time anywhere,\" Detective Inspector Darcy said.\n\n\"It is disappointing when it seems to be conveying a bit of violence,\" independent candidate Kate Hook said.\n\nOther corflutes in the electorate have been targeted with racist remarks or stolen, while Nazi symbols have been scrawled on billboards.\n\nIn another marginal seat, Liberal candidate for Wentworth Ro Knox has also had hundreds of posters vandalised or stolen -- some even set on fire or smeared with animal faeces.\n\nMany in the Sydney seat, currently held by independent Allegra Spender, have also been vandalised with anti-Semitic symbols and language.\n\nMs Knox said she understood many residents were fed up with the \"poster wars\", and pledged to not use campaign posters on public property in the next campaign if elected.\n\n\"We're all over the waste, the visual pollution, the silly games where people are tearing down and defacing posters,\" she said.\n\nDeputy Greens leader Mehreen Faruqi, whose signs have been targeted, said the problem was getting worse.\n\n\"What's happening out there clearly goes beyond ordinary vandalism -- this is politically motivated hate,\" she told the ABC.\n\nAustralian National University political marketing lecturer Andrew Hughes said the worst instances of vandalism appeared to be in seats with three of four candidates, particularly where a teal or independent candidate was running.\n\n\"All of a sudden a lot of these races are too hard to call so people revert to, sadly, aggressive behaviour like this to get their candidate elected again,\" he said.\n\n\"We have to accept we're entering a new era where traditional two-way races between major party candidates will become a thing of the past in some areas, even areas where we thought that wouldn't happen like Calare, like Wannon.\"\n\nMr Hughes said the behaviour actually worked against the candidate the vandal thought they were helping.\n\n\"You notice the sign left untouched and then people start thinking: 'Hang on, that party's playing dirty,'\" he said.\n\nPauline Hanson's One Nation party has also been targeted, with a man who hid his face with a mask caught on video slashing through candidate Stuart Bonds's corflutes in the electorate of Hunter in New South Wales.\n\nFrustrated locals or far-right actors?\n\nSo who is behind the attacks? Dr Blair Williams said the culprits were likely a mix of bored teenagers, supporters of political opponents, and extremists. And in many instances, it's hard to tell.\n\n\"I can imagine some of the people stealing signs would be frustrated community members ... whether it be the cost of living crisis or what's happening in Gaza,\" she said.\n\n\"But then there are the more insidious actors. In the last federal election some corflutes were defaced by neo-Nazi groups with neo-Nazi signage, and you're seeing some more hate speech vandalism as well this election.\"",

            "title": "Sanity returns as feds condemn transgender treatments for kids",
            "body": "The United States has finally acknowledged the truth: Sex-change treatments endanger children.\n\nOn Thursday, the federal Department of Health and Human Services issued the world's most comprehensive report on the topic to date -- a definitive 400-page evidentiary and ethical takedown.\n\nTransgender activists have long relied on the support of the US government -- or at least its silence -- to protect their claimed medical and moral legitimacy and continue treatment on children as young as age 8.\n\nNow they have nowhere to turn but the fringe, which is where their ideology arose and ought to return.\n\nThe most remarkable thing about this report is that it took so long.\n\nOther nations, especially in Europe, have conducted their own reviews of the evidence in recent years.\n\nThey have broadly concluded that treatments like puberty blockers, cross-sex hormones and sex-change surgeries have more documented risks than potential benefits for children.\n\nLast summer, for example, Great Britain all but banned the use of puberty blockers -- the first and foundational treatment in child sex-change procedures -- after the publication of a National Health Service report by Dr. Hilary Cass.\n\nYet the US government has refused to grapple with the evidence, much less admit it, until now.\n\nIn the meantime, at least 14,000 American children have been subjected to these interventions, as our organization has documented.\n\nThe HHS report notes from the start that medical practitioners have a \"professional and ethical obligation to protect and promote their patients' health.\"\n\nThat obligation strongly counsels against hormones and surgeries for children, since, as the report notes, there's little evidence of benefits of sex-change treatments -- but plenty of proof of their harm.\n\nThe evidence shows that sex changes for children can lead to infertility, sterility, cognitive problems, cardiovascular disease, metabolic disorders, mental-health disorders and more.\n\nAnd, as the report also notes, additional suffering may soon come to light -- because existing studies fail \"to systematically track and report harms.\"\n\nWe already know, as the report makes clear, that child sex changes are happening amid a broader mental-health crisis among kids.\n\nPsychotherapy, not experimental drugs and invasive surgeries, is necessary to treat underlying mental issues like anxiety and depression.\n\nActivists have mischaracterized psychotherapy as \"conversion therapy,\" the HHS report notes -- yet Britain and the Scandinavian countries now recommend these non-invasive treatments as the primary intervention.\n\nThe unnamed authors don't mince words about what medical professionals should -- and shouldn't -- do in cases of gender distress.\n\n\"When medical interventions pose unnecessary, disproportionate risks of harm, health care providers should refuse to offer them,\" they instruct, \"even when they are preferred, requested, or demanded by patients.\"\n\nFailing to heed this guidance, they write, threatens the foundations of medicine itself.\n\nHonest medical practitioners and experts have known from the beginning that child transgender treatments are risky and largely experimental.\n\nYet honesty was never the goal for many activists, as the HHS report also shows.\n\nThe World Professional Association for Transgender Health, which publishes the most widely used child treatment guidelines, \"suppressed systematic reviews its leaders believed would undermine its favored treatment approach.\"\n\nWPATH's guideline developers also \"eliminated nearly all recommended age minimums for medical and surgical interventions in response to political pressures.\"\n\nThis is the definition of putting ideology ahead of evidence.\n\nNow the HHS report must shape government action.\n\nIt provides the necessary scientific support to implement President Trump's January order to \"take all appropriate actions to end\" treatments that endanger children.\n\nThat could include ending Medicare and Medicaid coverage of such treatments -- and perhaps private health-insurance coverage as well.\n\nThe Office of Management and Budget has sought to block federal research and education grants to institutions that perform child sex-change treatments, and the report adds weight to that effort.\n\nThe findings should also spur National Institutes of Health Director Dr. Jay Bhattacharya to release the results of its decade-long study on the effects of puberty-blocking drugs on children.\n\nThat study's author, prominent transgender activist Johanna Olson-Kennedy, has refused to release the data -- while admitting they didn't show promised mental-health improvements.\n\nNIH should now fund new, non-biased studies to analyze the effects of sex-change treatments on those who received them as children, including the rates of regret and the prevalence of de-transitioning.\n\nThursday's report proves that our federal government is finally willing to put medical science ahead of gender activism.\n\nWashington has sided with ideologues for too long, giving cover to the notion that sex changes for children are consequence-free and medically necessary.\n\nIn fact, the proven harms outweigh unproven benefits.\n\nBy finally speaking truth to the activists' power, the United States has taken the most important global step yet in protecting children from transgender ideology.",
