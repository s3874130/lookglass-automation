            "title": "Determinants of melon farmers' adaptation strategies to climate change hazards in south\u2012south Nigeria - Scientific Reports",
            "body": "Hence, when R2 is equal to zero (R2\u2009=\u20090), this implies that no collinearity exists; then, the tolerance is high (equal to 1). The results are shown in Table 3.\n\nTable 3 shows that multicollinearity does not occur, which indicates that the variables were not correlated. At most, some variables (such as age) have a low level of multicollinearity. This indicates a relative correlation since the VIFs were greater than one (1) within the acceptable region and the tolerance level (approximately equal to one, T\u2009=\u20091) was high, as shown in Table 3; therefore, the model is accurate and appropriate for measuring the data collected.\n\nThe melon farmers' socioeconomic characteristics are shown in Table 4. It is inferred from the standard deviations, which express the level of disparity in the variables, that there was great disparity in the climate change adaptation strategies and revenue obtained among the farmers. This may be attributed to the different climate change adaptation strategies adopted by the farmers. The average age (49.44 years) of the melon farmers indicated that the farmers were active and productive. Additionally, the average (0.38 ha) size of cultivated farms, which was very small, indicated that the farmers were mostly small-scale farmers with an average of 23.01 years of sufficient farming experience.\n\nTable 5 shows the results of the MVP model of climate change adaptation strategies adopted by the melon farmers. Bartlett's test of sphericity and the loglikelihood chi-squared test were performed, and 174.401 results were obtained; these results were statistically significant at the 1% level, with the null hypothesis that the residual covariance matrix is proportional to an identity matrix. The coefficient of multiple determination (R) showed that approximately 20% of the magnitude of climate change adaptation strategies adopted were explained by the independent variables included in the model, while an adjusted R2 of 0.141 demonstrated the correct measurement of the model. The partial eta squared test was used to measure the extent to which the independent variable(s) affected the dependent variable.\n\nTable 5 shows that age, with a coefficient of - 0.009 (p value of 0.008), is statistically significant at the 1% level and negatively impacts the likelihood of adopting crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. A one-unit increase in the age of the farmer could reduce the chances of adopting crop diversification by 0.9%, suggesting that increasing the adaptation age would increase the chances of melon-based farmers adopting crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. The negative coefficient for age shows that young melon farmers may diversify crops more than aged farmers do; this could be the result of young farmers innovating and trying new adaptation strategies to enhance their melon production. This result is in agreement with that of Enimu and Onome, who found among farmers in Delta State that, regardless of whether older farmers are aware of new innovations, they are not willing to adopt new adaptation strategies. A partial eta squared of 0.029 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy.\n\nMarital status, with a coefficient of 0.200 (p value of 0.002), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. A unit increase in the marital status of the farmer could increase the chances of adopting crop diversification by 20%, suggesting that an increase in marital status would increase the chances of melon-based farmers adopting crop diversification as a means of adapting to climate change. This finding implies that married melon farmers could adopt crop diversification more than their single counterparts. A partial eta squared of 0.040 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. Household size, with a coefficient of - 0.030 (p value 0.031), is statistically significant at the 5% level and negatively impacts the probability of adopting crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. An increase in the household size of a farmer could reduce the chances of adopting crop diversification by melon farmers when adopting crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. The negative coefficient of household size implies that melon farmers with smaller household sizes are more prone to adopting crop diversification to cope with the effects of climate change. A partial eta squared of 0.019 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy.\n\nAccess to information concerning climate change, with a coefficient of 0.567 (p value of 0.000), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. A one-unit increase in access to information related to climate change could increase the likelihood of adopting crop diversification by 56.7%, suggesting that adapting to climate change would improve the likelihood of melon-based farmers adopting crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. This implies that timely access to information related to climate change could increase the rate of climate change adaptation strategies through crop diversification. The melon farmer who received information earlier could adopt the strategy than the farmers who may obtain the information late. These findings are in agreement with those of Gemeda, Korecha and Garedew, who reported that access to climate information is correlated with crop diversification in Ethiopia. A partial eta squared of 0.094 was obtained, which indicates a medium effect on the use of crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. Awareness of farm/crop insurance, with a coefficient of 0.214 (p value of 0.012), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. A unit increase in awareness of crop insurance could increase the chances of adopting crop diversification by melon farmers by 21.4%, suggesting that the awareness of crop insurance would improve the chances of melon-based farmers adopting crop diversification as a means of adaptation to climate change. This implies that transferring the losses that may be encountered in maize production is possible through insurance companies. A partial eta squared of 0.026 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of crop diversification as a climate change adaptation strategy. The multivariate probit (MVP) model results, consequently, provide appropriate support for simultaneous adaptation choices.\n\nTable 5 shows that educational level, with a coefficient of 0.012 (p value of 0.028), is statistically significant at the 5% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting changing planting dates as a means of adapting to climate change. An increase in the year needed to reach the educational level of the farmer could increase the probability of adopting change planting dates by melon farmers when adopting change planting dates as climate change adaptation strategies. This means that the more years the melon farmers spent to reach the level of education, the more significant is the study and change in the planting date of maize for efficient productivity. This finding is inconsistent with those of Mwinkom, Damnyag, Abugre and Alhassan, who obtained a negative coefficient among farmers in North\u2011Western Ghana. A partial eta squared of 0.020 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of changing planting dates as climate change adaptation strategies.\n\nAccess to information concerning climate change, with a coefficient of 0.415 (p value of 0.000), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting change planting dates as climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in access to information on climate change could increase the chances of adopting change planting dates by 41.5%, suggesting that adapting to climate change would improve the chances of melon-based farmers utilizing change planting dates as climate change adaptation strategies. This finding is consistent with that of Mwinkom et al., who reported that climate change influences the change in planting time in Ghana. A partial eta squared of 0.052 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of changes in planting date as climate change adaptation strategies. With a coefficient of 0.138 (p value 0.024), agricultural extension contact is statistically significant at the 5% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting change in planting dates as a climate change adaptation strategy. An increase in agricultural extension contact could increase the chances of adopting climate change adaptation strategies to change planting dates. This implies that agricultural extension services offer vital and accurate information about climate change and are capable of providing good agricultural and management practices, including operational practices, to address climate change. Hence, farmers with better contact with the extension have a greater chance of altering planting dates for maximum yields even during climate challenges. This finding is consistent with Nhemachena, Hassan and Chakwizira, who reported that increasing access to free agricultural extension services may considerably enhance farmers' awareness of changes in climatic factors and, in addition, adaptation strategies to adapt to climate change hazards. A partial eta squared of 0.021 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of change in planting as a climate change adaptation strategy.\n\nAccess to credit facilities, with a coefficient of 0.122 (p value of 0.042), is statistically significant at the 5% level and positively impacts the possibility of adopting changing planting dates as a means of adapting to climate change. An increase in credit accessibility facilities could increase the chances of adopting changing planting dates by melon farmers when adopting changing planting dates as climate change adaptation strategies. This implies that for melon farmers to adapt to climate variability, productive financing is needed. A partial eta squared of 0.017 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the usage of change in planting as a climate change adaptation strategy. Hence, the results of the multivariate probit (MVP) model provide sufficient support for simultaneous and codependent adaptation choices.\n\nTable 5 shows that age, with a coefficient of - 0.010 (p value of 0.005), is statistically significant at the 1% level and negatively impacts the likelihood of adopting mixed farming -- crops and rearing of livestock -- as a means of adapting to climate change. A one-unit increase in the age of the farmer could reduce the chances of adopting mixed farming -- cropping and rearing of livestock -- by 1%, suggesting that increasing the adaptation age would increase the chances of melon-based farmers adopting mixed farming -- cropping and rearing of livestock as climate change adaptation systems. This implies that mixed farming approaches are better able to withstand climate change factors through different changes in management strategies; this is possible because younger farmers can actually carry out many activities at or almost the same time. This finding is consistent with that of Nhemachena et al., who noted that mixed farming approaches have already been adopted and that farmers have several alternative crops and livestock choices that could guarantee that one choice fails as a consequence of climate change, while the other would do well even if there are variations in climatic factors. A partial eta squared of 0.031 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the usage of mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy.\n\nGender, with a coefficient of - 0.139 (p value of 0.014), is statistically significant at the 5% level and negatively impacts the likelihood of adopting mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. An increase in the gender of the farmer could reduce the chances of adopting mixed farming by melon farmers when adopting mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. This implies that female melon farmers may be affected. These findings agree with those of Nyadzi, Werners, Biesbroek, Long, Franssen and Ludwig, who reported that male farmers are more likely to adopt climate adaptation strategies than their female farmer counterparts are. A partial eta squared of 0.025 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the usage of mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. Marital status, with a coefficient of 0.158 (p value of 0.016), is statistically significant at the 5% level and negatively impacts the probability of utilizing mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. An increase in the marital status of farmers could increase their chances of adopting mixed farming by adopting mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. This implies that married melon farmers could adopt mixed farming more than their single-farmer counterparts. A partial eta squared of 0.023 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the utilization of mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy.\n\nOff-farm income, with a coefficient of - 2.312E-7 (p value of 0.044), is statistically significant at the 5% level and negatively impacts the probability of adopting mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. An increase in the off-farm income of farmers could increase their chances of adopting mixed farming by adopting mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. This means that melon farmers could spend their off-farm income to adapt to climate change adaptation strategies. A partial eta squared of 0.017 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. Access to information concerning climate change, with a coefficient of 0.381 (p value of 0.001), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of implementing mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. A one-unit increase in access to information related to climate change could increase the likelihood of adopting mixed farming by 38.1%, suggesting that adapting access to information related to climate change would improve the likelihood of maize-based farmers adopting mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. This implies that access to information on climate change is crucial for productive adaptation. A partial eta squared of 0.041 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the utilization of mixed farming as a climate change adaptation strategy. The multivariate probit (MVP) model results, consequently, provide appropriate support for simultaneous adaptation choices.\n\nTable 5 shows that farming experience, with a coefficient of 0.005 (p value of 0.030), is statistically significant at the 5% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting planting drought-tolerant crop species as a climate change adaptation strategy. An increase in farming experience could increase the chances of adopting climate change adaptation strategies by melon farmers to plant drought-tolerant crop species. This implies that an increase in the farming experience of melon farmers could lead to a better understanding of drought-tolerant crop species. A partial eta squared of 0.019 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of drought-tolerant crop species as climate change adaptation strategies.\n\nAccess to information concerning climate change, with a coefficient of 0.529 (p value of 0.000), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting planting drought-tolerant crop species as climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in access to information related to climate change could increase the chances of adopting drought-tolerant crop species by 52.9% of melon farmers, suggesting that adapting to climate change would improve the chances of melon-based farmers adopting the planting of drought-tolerant crop species as climate change adaptation strategies. This implies that access to information on climate change is crucial for productive adaptation. A partial eta squared of 0.082 was obtained, which indicates a medium effect on the use of planting drought-tolerant crop species as climate change adaptation strategies.\n\nAwareness of farm/crop insurance, with a coefficient of 0.272 (p value of 0.001), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting planting drought-tolerant crop species as climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in access to information related to climate change could increase the chances of adopting planting drought-tolerant crop species by 27.2% of melon farmers, suggesting that adapting access to information related to climate change would improve the chances of melon-based farmers adopting the planting of drought-tolerant crop species as climate change adaptation strategies. This implies that transferring the losses that may be encountered in maize production is possible through insurance companies. A partial eta squared of 0.082 was obtained, which indicates a medium effect on the use of planting drought-tolerant crop species as climate change adaptation strategies. The MVP model results, consequently, provide appropriate support for simultaneous adaptation choices.\n\nTable 5 shows that access to information on climate change, with a coefficient of 0.536 (p value of 0.000), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting improved crop species as climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in access to information related to climate change could increase the chances of adopting improved crop species by maize farmers by 53.6%, suggesting that adapting access to information related to climate change would improve the chances of melon-based farmers adopting improved crop species as climate change adaptation strategies. This implies that access to information related to climate change is crucial for productive adaptation. A partial eta squared of 0.090 was obtained, which indicates a medium effect on the use of planting drought-tolerant crop species as a means of adapting to climate change.\n\nTable 5 shows that age, with a coefficient of - 0.010 (p value of 0.024), is statistically significant at the 5% level and negatively impacts the probability of adopting off-farm job opportunities as a climate change adaptation strategy. An increase in the age of the farmer could increase the chances of adopting off-farm job opportunities by helping melon farmers adopt off-farm job opportunities as climate change adaptation strategies. This implies that younger melon farmers could engage in multiple activities to withstand climate change effects. A partial eta squared of 0.021 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the use of off-farm job opportunities as climate change adaptation strategies.\n\nWith a coefficient of - 0.085 (p value 0.033), melon farm size is statistically significant at the 5% level and negatively impacts the probability of adopting off-farm job opportunities as climate change adaptation strategies. An increase in the size of melon farms could increase the likelihood of adopting off-farm jobs by helping melon farmers adopt off-farm jobs as climate change adaptation strategies. This implies that obtaining too many off-farm jobs could lead to climate change adaptation, which could result in a low yield of melon. A partial eta squared of 0.019 was obtained, which indicates a medium effect on the use of off-farm job opportunities as climate change adjustment strategies. Access to information on climate change, with a coefficient of 0.353 (p value of 0.012), is statistically significant at the 1% level and positively impacts the probability of adopting off-farm job opportunities as climate change adaptation strategies. A unit increase in access to information on climate change could increase the likelihood of adopting off-farm job opportunities by melon farmers by 35.3%, suggesting that adapting to climate change would improve the likelihood of melon-based farmers adopting off-farm job opportunities as climate change adaptation strategies. This implies that access to information on climate change is crucial for productive adaptation. A partial eta squared of 0.025 was obtained, which indicates a medium effect on the use of off-farm job opportunities as climate change adaptation strategies.\n\nAwareness of farm/crop insurance, with a coefficient of 0.206 (p value of 0.049), is statistically significant at the 5% level and negatively impacts the probability of adopting off-farm job opportunities as climate change adaptation strategies. An increase in awareness of farm/crop insurance could increase the chances of adopting off-farm jobs by helping melon farmers adopt off-farm jobs as climate change adaptation actions. This implies that melon farmers could raise funds to register and pay the premium required by the insurance provider/company. A partial eta squared of 0.016 was obtained, which indicates a small effect on the usage of off-farm job opportunities as climate change adaptation strategies. The MVP model results, consequently, provide appropriate support for simultaneous adaptation choices.",

            "title": "Security Council: The impact of climate change and food insecurity on international peace and security - World",
            "body": "Due to the financial liquidity crisis affecting the United Nations and the resulting time constraints, the full press release will be published at a later date.\n\nBriefings\n\nANT\u00d3NIO GUTERRES, Secretary-General of the United Nations, underscored that climate chaos and food crises are serious and mounting threats to global peace and security and, as such, should be addressed by the Security Council. \"A global food crisis is creating a hellscape of hunger and heartache for many of the world's poorest people,\" he said. And the climate crisis is accelerating with a deadly force -- 2023 was the hottest year ever. Climate disasters and conflict both inflame inequalities, imperil livelihoods and force people from their homes. Conflict can easily be sparked where tensions are high, institutions are weak, and people are marginalized, with women and girls paying the highest price. Climate and conflict are two leading drivers of the global food crisis, he said, stressing: \"Where wars rage, hunger reigns -- whether due to displacement of people, destruction of agriculture, damage to infrastructure, or deliberate policies of denial.\"\n\nMeanwhile, he continued, climate chaos is imperilling food production. Floods and droughts destroy crops, ocean changes disrupt fishing, rising seas degrade land and freshwater, and shifting weather patterns ruin harvests and spawn pests. Climate and conflict were the main causes of acute food insecurity for almost 174 million people in 2022. Spotlighting examples of the devastating relationship between hunger and conflict, he said that, in Syria, almost 13 million people go to bed hungry after a decade of war and a horrendous earthquake; in Myanmar, conflict and political instability have thrown progress towards ending hunger into reverse; in Gaza, no one has enough to eat -- \"of the 700,000 hungriest people in the world, four in five inhabit that tiny strip of land\". All of the 14 countries most at risk from climate change are suffering conflict.\n\nHe further voiced concern over a resurgence of food inflation as droughts sap the Panama Canal and violence hits the Red Sea -- throwing supply chains into disarray. \"Without action, the situation will deteriorate,\" he warned, adding that conflicts are multiplying. The World Food Programme (WFP) estimates that over 330 million people were affected by acute food insecurity in 2023. And it has warned of an acute deterioration in 18 \"hunger hotspots\" early this year. Underscoring the need to \"act now to break the deadly links between conflict, climate and food insecurity,\" he called on all parties to all conflicts to abide by international humanitarian law. The starvation of civilians may constitute a war crime, he stressed, calling for unimpeded humanitarian access. The Council has a critical role in demanding compliance. Additionally, humanitarian operations must be funded in full to prevent disaster and conflict from feeding hunger.\n\n\"Turbocharging progress towards the Sustainable Development Goals -- including our goal of zero hunger -- is the answer,\" he said. Highlighting \"a grotesque disparity between allocation and need\" -- globally, almost a third of food is wasted while hundreds of millions of people go to bed hungry every night -- he underlined the need \"to create food systems that feed the planet without wrecking the planet\". It is also essential to finance social protection systems to protect livelihoods and ensure basic access to services. To strengthen global peace and security frameworks, it is vital that States make the most of the Summit of the Future, where they will consider the proposed New Agenda for Peace. As \"climate action is action for food security and action for peace\", Group of 20 (G20) nations must lead a just global phase-out of fossil fuels, in line with the principle of common but differentiated responsibilities.\n\nTurning to financing, he emphasized that developing countries -- burdened by the cost-of-living crisis and unsustainable debt levels -- simply cannot afford to invest in climate action and resilient food systems. To this end, he proposed a Sustainable Development Goals (SDG) Recovery Plan -- worth $500 billion annually -- for affordable, long-term financing for sustainable development and climate action. At the same time, developing countries must prioritize expenditure to achieve the SDGs. \"It is distressing to see Governments' expenditures of untold sums in weaponry while continuously reducing the budgets dedicated to food security, climate action, and sustainable development,\" he observed. It is also crucial to ensure that financing for climate action reaches people and places experiencing conflict. \"The message is clear: we can break the deadly nexus of hunger, climate chaos, and conflict,\" he asserted, stating: \"Let's act to do so and build a liveable, sustainable future, free from hunger, and free from the scourge of war.\"\n\nSIMON STIELL, Executive Secretary of the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change, said that a few years ago, the world believed hunger could be eradicated. Today, 1 in 10 people on earth already suffers from chronic hunger, which is unacceptable. If climate change accelerates, it will become worse. \"Climate change is contributing to food insecurity and to conflict,\" he declared, calling for rapid, sustained action to cut greenhouse gas emissions and increase resilience. The world is heating fast. Storms are becoming stronger and more destructive. According to the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, food production is already lower than it would have been without climate change. In the not-too-distant future, there could be huge supply shocks, and if heating continues, food production will decline across many countries. \"The combination of climate change, hunger, and war is a devastating one,\" he said, adding: \"There is no national security without food security. And there will be no food security without enhanced action to stop climate change.\"\n\nHowever, solutions exist, he said, pointing to the role of the Framework Convention, which includes in its reports the role climate change and food security play in driving conflict. The Convention also can forge partnerships and collaborations to address exacerbating factors. \"We must acknowledge more can be done rather than hoping the problem will go away -- which it won't,\" he said. The Council should be requesting a regular stream of information on climate security risks, and the Framework Convention can help in this regard. \"But ultimately, this forum should be abreast of this crisis driver in real time to aid in better decision-making,\" he said. For example, the programming of vertical funds that acknowledges conflict sensitivity should also be climate-sensitive.\n\nHe went on to underscore the vital role of national adaptation plans, climate finance, and new and stronger nationally determined contributions in reducing vulnerability and preventing hunger and conflict. Every national adaptation plan submitted to the Framework Convention to date identifies increasing food security as a priority. Investing in climate resilience and adaptation, including changing agricultural practices towards regenerative food production, would blunt the damage from extreme climate events, he said. Adaptation finance needs are at least 10 times greater than current international public finance flows. Developing countries, excluding China, require $2.4 trillion annually to build clean energy economies and adapt to climate impacts. \"Compared to the spiraling costs of crisis and conflict, they pale,\" he said, adding that done right, climate finance will benefit countries with significant humanitarian needs.\n\nIt is imperative to limit further temperature rise, he insisted. Nationally determined contributions, national climate targets and plans must be aligned with the goals of the Paris Agreement on climate change, cover every greenhouse gas, and lay out how each sector of the economy will transition. They must include measures to protect food security. All countries are due to submit these new plans by early next year, he noted. \"They need to be ambitious and keep alive the possibility of limiting warming to 1.5\u00b0C,\" he said. Investment in adaptation, resilience, and clean energy can increase prosperity and food security and help avoid future conflicts. \"Done right, climate action can help build peace,\" he concluded.\n\nBETH BECHDOL, Deputy Director-General, Food and Agriculture Organization (FAO), said climate and conflict are the most important issues requiring urgent action to address global food insecurity. Highlighting the alarming effect of climate change on agri-food systems -- \"how and when we produce, harvest, process and store our food\" -- she said the climate crisis spares no one, but it does not affect everyone equally or in the same way. The populations at greatest risk are those that depend on agriculture and natural resources because their livelihoods are vulnerable to climate change impacts, and their capacity to respond is limited, making them prone to disputes arising from the scarcity of natural resources. Stressing that there is no food security without peace, and no peace without food security, she said it is no coincidence that half of the world's hungry people live in conflict-affected zones.\n\nNoting that 258 million people in 58 countries are facing high levels of acute food insecurity, she said that over two thirds -- 174 million people -- are there because of climate and conflict. As much as 70 per cent of the most climate-vulnerable countries are also among the most politically and economically fragile. The current limited area of food production will be further diminished by 10 per cent by mid-century under high-emission scenarios, she cautioned. It is small-scale farmers, pastoralists, foresters and fisherfolk who will bear the brunt of climate impacts, due to their dependence on soil, water, land and other natural resources. \"I see this on my own family's farm in the Midwest of the United States and I see it first-hand in Afghanistan, Somalia, Kenya, Uganda and elsewhere,\" she said, underscoring the need to equip farmers and communities to prepare for and respond to these crises.\n\nSharing more examples of the complex interlinkages between climate change and conflict, she pointed to how migratory routes for livestock herding in West and Central Africa have altered. While such cross-border herding used to be peaceful historically, growing competition for already scarce natural resources has led to tensions. She also highlighted the FAO's efforts to mitigate such conflicts, including in Yemen, where it has implemented a \"water for peace\" project that empowers women as conflict-resolution agents. The international community must prioritize investments to build climate-resilient agri-food systems. The Council must request United Nations entities to regularly analyze and report on risks and links associated with climate change. The world cannot afford to leave behind farmers, pastoralists, fisherfolk and foresters, she stressed.\n\nJIMENA LEIVA ROESCH, Director of Global Initiatives and Head of Climate, Peace and Sustainable Development, International Peace Institute, acknowledged \"how difficult it is to figure out where climate change fits in the Security Council\". It is not \"boots on the ground\", nor is it \"an enemy we can name\" or an \"us versus them\" situation. She therefore asked: how can the Council respond to the calls so many developing countries have made? She warned that the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change is unequivocal on how all human systems will be impacted once the planet crosses the threshold of 1.5\u00baC. The oceans and forests, \"our greatest carbon sinks\", soon will not be able to provide oxygen for humanity, while extreme heat becomes an unbearable reality, affecting crops. Further, substantial human displacement is on the horizon, while warm-water coral reefs will cease to exist, deeply affecting global fish stocks.\n\nAs rising oceans claim land and islands, she called for rethinking the link between sovereignty and territory loss enshrined in the Montevideo Principles, as island States will need to keep their sovereignty when they lose land. For many middle-income countries, the crisis is coupled with high debt and unfair rules in global trade and finance. \"The food security of billions hangs in the balance,\" she stressed. She emphasized that the Council can examine how climate magnifies existing realities beyond the countries on its agenda, examining its role in a 1.5\u00baC world, and invoking Article 34 of the Charter of the United Nations, indicating: the Council may investigate any situation which might lead to international friction or give rise to a dispute or situation likely to endanger the maintenance of peace and security. Members of the Council could set up a provisional investigative body to better understand the links between food security climate and conflict at current warming levels of 1.48\u00baC.\n\nSetting up this body under Article 34 would send a new message to the world that the Council is serious about the smallest of nations, she said, acknowledging that other institutions face challenges, including the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF). \"All our institutions, established in 1945, need expanded mandates,\" she affirmed, noting that the Charter provides the mandate. The resources are there to transform food systems -- all that is required is the leadership and will to repurpose $638 billion in subsidies that go against climate positive investment and barely trickle down to farmers. She stressed that \"climate is a challenge that unlike many others in the Council is not intractable but can be solved through cooperation, innovation, and a deep commitment to our shared future\".\n\nWe'd like your feedback.

Highlighting the dire consequences of conflict-driven hunger, he pointed to the fact that nearly 149 million Africans are currently facing acute food insecurity, with 122 million of them residing in conflict-affected areas. Drawing attention to the significant economic toll of conflicts, he cited the $5 billion needed to eradicate hunger caused by war in Africa and the $4 billion worth of agricultural losses in Ukraine due to conflict-induced land degradation. More than 6 million hectares of land in Colombia have been abandoned or seized as a result of conflict between 1980 and 2010. Disappointed over the lack of action by the international community, he said: \"We do not see the interplay and we do not place priority on these issues\".\n\nPutting a spotlight on the overlooked consequences of war, he underscored the significant economic, social and environmental damages inflicted, including land degradation, deforestation and greenhouse gas emissions. \"The war in Iraq generated 141 million of emission in four years, which is equivalent of 20 million cars in one year,\" he observed, highlighting an estimated 150 million tons of carbon dioxide expected from the conflict in Ukraine after 18 months of war. With the environmental and food impacts during the rebuilding phase not being calculated, he asked whether \"we are we going to be bold to calculate these damages and assign a value to the damage\". Noting that \"food and climate are sometimes missing from the overall analysis of the impact of war and conflict\", he urged the Security Council to adopt \"a very targeted approach\" to address the nexus of conflict, food security and climate change, while emphasizing the critical role of political will and global cooperation.\n\nYOUCEF CHERFA, Minister for Agriculture and Rural Development of Algeria, said rising temperatures, changing weather patterns, and sea-level rise are all factors that disrupt agriculture production, drive forced displacement and heighten competition over resources, thus fuelling conflict and instability. He spotlighted climate-change-related initiatives in his country, which aim to integrate renewable energy and climate-resilient crops in rural production. Conflict prevention mechanisms are necessary to tackle climate change, food security, and conflict. Also, he underlined the need to invest in building societies' resilience and ecological systems by supporting sustainable agricultural practices and promoting water preservation. He called for enhanced international cooperation through multinational partnerships and supporting international organizations such as WFP. Further, mechanisms should be funded to ensure sufficient financial support for developing countries.\n\nTurning to the tragic situation in Gaza, he said that, for more than five months, the Palestinian people have been subjected to intensified bombardment, as well as destruction of facilities by the occupying Power. This had led to the death of more than 28,000 people. \"This bombardment left nothing alive,\" he asserted, adding that it has caused a suffocating food crisis and deteriorating environmental situation in the region. The international community is a bystander in the face of these flagrant violations instead of putting an end to this \"Zionist aggression\". Also, the United Nations Relief and Works Agency for Palestine Refugees in the Near East (UNRWA) is subject to a systemic defamation campaign whose objective is to \"undermine its credibility (and) dry up sources of its funding\". Against this backdrop, he urged the Council to put an immediate end to the suffering of the Palestinian people and ensure the immediate delivery of aid to the affected people.\n\nMICHAEL S. REGAN, Administrator of the Environmental Protection Agency of the United States, said that climate change has been the topic of conversation on the world stage, with its impacts exacerbating food insecurity for many and causing instability. In 2023, the Horn of Africa experienced the worst drought in recorded history. No country is immune from these effects, not even his country, where in 2022, low food security households increased and roughly 36 per cent of the households with incomes below the federal poverty line were food insecure. The impacts of climate change and food insecurity often disproportionately affect those most vulnerable, he pointed out, highlighting Washington D.C.'s support for the Food Security and Nutrition for All initiative, tackling climate change mitigation and adaptation, and creating inclusive and equitable food systems that address the needs of the most vulnerable communities.\n\nAt the Twenty-eighth Session of the Conference of the Parties to the United Nations Framework Convention on Climate Change (COP28), the United States launched a national strategy for reducing food loss and waste and recycling organics, he said. Food loss and waste represent 8 per cent of global anthropogenic greenhouse gas emissions. \"When food is wasted, so is the opportunity to nourish people. When food is wasted, so are the resources that were used to produce, process, distribute, and prepare that food,\" he said, stressing the critical importance of reducing such loss and waste. That will also help provide social and economic benefits, leading to an increase in stability and security across the globe. The United States is working with the UN Environment Programme (UNEP) to help identify sources of food waste. \"As global leaders, we have a responsibility to foster conditions for increased peace and security in the world,\" he declared.\n\nSANJA \u0160TIGLIC, Deputy Minister for Foreign and European Affairs and State Secretary for Political and Multilateral Affairs and Development Cooperation of Slovenia, said climate change-induced weather extremes, such as droughts and floods, lead to natural resource shortages and food insecurity. Already fragile communities are usually hit the hardest, she said, pointing to climate change that has exposed millions of people in the Horn of Africa to acute food insecurity. Conflict risks escalate amid food and water scarcity. The growing gap between water supply and demand might lead to even more conflicts over water resources, arable land and food. On the other hand, armed conflicts also often lead to the devastation of food systems, she said, highlighting how the war in Gaza has devastated its water infrastructure and natural environment, considerably adding to the extreme suffering of a civilian population that is already facing severe food shortages. In Ukraine, the war has impacted global food supply chains, she noted.\n\n\"Long after the guns go silent,\" she said, armed conflicts continue to affect the environment through soil degradation, water pollution, habitat destruction and the dangers posed by landmines and unexploded ordnances. Calling on the United Nations to ensure the meaningful participation of women in addressing climate change and food insecurity, she said \"eating last and eating least is a daily reality of mothers in the most fragile communities\". The transboundary nature of climate change and food insecurity demands the response of the international community as a whole, she said, calling on the Organization to tap into the potential of new technologies and early warning systems to do this. Highlighting the way satellite imagery and artificial intelligence have revolutionized the prediction of climate threats, she said it is vital to identify potential conflict triggers before they escalate.\n\nALEXANDRA BAUMANN, State Secretary of Switzerland, noted that for a long time, conflicts and food insecurity were on the decline, but \"unfortunately, we failed to stay the course.\" Over the past decade, acute food insecurity has massively increased, with almost 800 million people facing chronic hunger and conflict as the primary cause. Pointing to scientific progress that has developed early warning systems for food insecurity, conflict and climatic urgences, she noted they must work together, as related challenges call for networked systems that link data in order to avoid blind spots. She further welcomed collaboration between the Council and the entire UN system, as well as regional organizations like the African Union, regional economic organizations, local players and science. The Council should also mandate UN missions to analyse the risks associated with climate change and serve as a platform for early warning and for mobilizing the efforts of the international community.\n\nWhile conflict, hunger and climate change interact differently in each context, she emphasized that \"the result is always the same: more instability and insecurity\", be it in the Sahel, Myanmar or Haiti. Recalling that the Council took action against conflict-induced hunger with resolution 2417 (2018), she called for its implementation. Noting that progress has been made on a case-by-case basis in several resolutions regarding the security impact of climate change, she expressed support for a consensus among Council members in adopting a strategic framework for coherent and responsible action. The tools exist to reinforce prevention, she affirmed. \"What is needed is the political will to seize them,\" which is \"our duty in the face of the triple threat of conflict, hunger and climate change.\" She reaffirmed that interconnected challenges require integrated responses, and by making prevention a political priority, the New Agenda for Peace \"can put us on the right track.\"\n\nYASUSHI HOSAKA, Parliamentary Vice-Minister for Foreign Affairs of Japan, said that the Council should tackle climate change, food security and conflict as these issues affect not only developing countries, but also international peace and security. A comprehensive approach, including enhancing the resilience of society, is the key to building peace, he said, recalling various high-level meetings held by Japan to highlight the importance of conflict prevention through a humanitarian, development, and peace nexus. This approach includes the empowerment of women, youth and vulnerable people. Encouraging the Council to make better use of the Peacebuilding Commission, he underscored that the latter should continue to broaden its scope to cover matters that can affect conflicts, such as those arising from climate change and food insecurity, and actively provide recommendations to the Council.\n\nHe went on to emphasize that comprehensive approaches are more effective at halting the increase of risks coming from climate change, as well as to break the vicious cycles that create further risks. Accordingly, Japan continues to support each country's efforts towards low-emission and climate-resilient development, including assistance for developing countries in both climate mitigation and adaptation. To this end, Japan has pledged $70 billion in climate finance over five years until 2025 to aid developing countries in combating climate change.\n\nThe representative of Mozambique, noting that the number of people suffering acute food insecurity has risen significantly, stressed that the interplay among climate, conflict, and food systems presents a series of challenges for maintaining international peace and security. The most vulnerable countries of Africa -- including Mozambique -- and small island developing States have been seriously threatened by weather disasters. They are facing acute security and development challenges, particularly in food security and cyclical occurrence of extreme events. Further, climate change exacerbates tensions and conflicts among communities, with a disproportionate impact on women and children. The perception paradigm on maintaining international peace and security must be changed to protect the most vulnerable. He emphasized that climate change and food insecurity are challenges that must be addressed collectively, with a sense of urgency and responsibility.\n\nThe representative of the United Kingdom said that climate change, environmental degradation and biodiversity loss are exacerbating conflict, contributing to global food insecurity, and threatening international peace and security. These linked challenges require a coordinated international response, she stressed, urging early action to prevent and resolve food security crises. Her country has announced a new fund to help climate adaptation and increase anticipatory approaches and has also pledged \u00a3100 million to help vulnerable countries tackle climate change, including support for early warning systems and disaster risk finance. The United Kingdom is also investing in innovation to increase sustainable, climate-resilient food production. Noting the need for a holistic and integrated approach to resilience, development, security and climate change, she insisted that current and projected climate impacts should be fully integrated into conflict risk assessments. The UN system, including its cadre of climate security advisers, is well-positioned to coordinate climate, food security, and peace efforts, she added.\n\nThe representative of Sierra Leone, highlighting the cross-regional nature of climate change and food insecurity in Africa, said the competition for dwindling natural resources heightens the risk of conflict within and between nations. In the Sahel, climate change disproportionately affects 50 million people who depend on agriculture and livestock, while in Sudan there are reports that water points are hotspots for disputes that have escalated into violent clashes. Citing a 2023 Global Report on Food Crises, he said that in West Africa, the Sahel and parts of Central Africa, the levels of acute food insecurity during the June-August 2023 lean season were projected to be the highest on record. Stressing the need to integrate climate and food security into conflict prevention, he called for risk assessments to identify vulnerable regions. The international community should also support dialogue and mediation between communities competing for resources. Moreover, it is necessary to invest in climate-resilient agricultural practices such as drought-resistant crops and water-efficient irrigation and agroforestry, he said.\n\nThe representative of France stressed that the Russian Federation's war of aggression against Ukraine has seriously exacerbated the global food crisis. She called for full implementation of resolution 2417 (2018), further urging Special Representatives to provide the Council with precise information during their briefings, with recommendations for targeted actions for certain areas, in particular Africa. The 15-member body must also place greater emphasis on risk prevention, strengthening the mandates of United Nations missions so that they can support the most vulnerable countries in risk assessment and management. She noted that Climate, Peace and Security Advisers deployed to Missions help support countries in strengthening their capacities in risk assessment and management, working to strengthen partnerships with local and regional stakeholders. France is particularly engaged with the United Nations Office in Central Africa (UNOCA). She called on Member States to join the United Nations \"Climate, Peace and Security\" Inter-Agency Mechanism, taking a field-centered approach.\n\nThe representative of the Russian Federation pointed out that climate and socioeconomic issues do not directly relate to the Council's mandate. Turning to the \"real causes\" of the problems faced by developing countries, he criticized neo-colonialist practices perpetuated by Western countries -- former colonial Powers -- which did not carry out restitution for the damage caused and instead continue to hinder the socioeconomic progress of developing nations. \"Although formally colonialism is a relic of the past, in fact its most grotesque manifestations continue to flourish today,\" he said, pointing to the exploitation of sovereign natural resources by Western transnational companies as well as military aggression against \"unfavourable\" nations. According to United Nations estimates, there is no shortage of food in the world, he observed, stressing that the real issue is the unequal distribution of food supplies and \"price conjuncture\", while condemning sanctions imposed by Western countries, attributing them to political agendas that undermine global food security.\n\nThe representative of China, describing climate change as \"a critical issue closely linked to humanity's survival\", said that, in recent years, the Council has devoted its attention to the connection between climate change and security. However, some conflicts do not have a direct linkage to climate change, he observed, adding that each situation should be studied on its own merit to determine the causes and the points of intervention. Targeted action is needed to help developing countries enhance climate resilience, ensure food security, and break the vicious cycle of climate, hunger, and conflict. He also urged for strengthened global humanitarian assistance, stressing that some countries in Asia, Africa, and Latin America are facing severe food crises. Nevertheless, he emphasized that humanitarian assistance should not be used as a tool for exerting pressure, nor should it be subject to any political conditions. On the divide between the Global South and North, he said that global food production is fully sufficient to feed everyone, yet nearly 800 million people go hungry.\n\nThe representative of the Republic of Korea said that the interlinkages between climate change, food insecurity, and peace and security are playing out in countries, including Myanmar, Afghanistan and South Sudan. Noting the need for climate-sensitive peacemaking efforts as well as conflict-sensitive adaptation, he underscored the great potential the Peacebuilding Commission holds towards this objective. The Commission should convene climate-focused country or region-specific meetings with the participation of UN missions and agencies, UN climate security mechanism and multilateral development banks. His country has launched a project to assist 10 sub-Saharan African countries in localizing and improving rice production capacity, he said, underscoring Seoul's ongoing efforts to strengthen partnership with the Global South in their transition to clean energy and climate change adaptation, including by scaling up its \"green\" official development assistance (ODA).\n\nThe representative of Malta emphasized that populations in conflict-affected areas face acute food and water insecurity or starvation, with women and girls currently accounting for 70 per cent of the world's hungry. Climate-related impacts jeopardize agri-food systems and water resources, which, in turn, fuel competition over limited availability of natural resources, driving population mobility and displacement, she observed. Highlighting the numerous flashpoints worldwide that have left millions vulnerable to hunger and displacement, she called for \"a holistic and integrated approach within the United Nations system\". In this regard, she recalled Council resolution 2417 (2018) recognizing the need to break the vicious cycle between armed conflict and food insecurity. \"In all our actions we must involve local actors, including women, human rights and environmental defenders,\" she stressed, urging the allocation of climate financing to support grassroots women's organizations spearheading local adaptation and mitigation initiatives.\n\nThe representative of Ecuador, aligning himself with the statement to be delivered by the Group of Friends of Action on Conflict and Hunger, highlighted Council resolution 2417 (2018) as a valuable tool for early warning and response. Condemning the use of starvation as a war tactic, he also noted Council resolution 2692 (2023), concerning Haiti, which urged all relevant actors, including those with the ability to influence armed groups, to act to stop blocking access to local markets and food supplies. The climate crisis is a threat multiplier that endangers agri-food systems and water resources, he said, expressing support for early warning systems and climate change adaptation strategies for the most vulnerable countries. Climate financing is key, he stressed, highlighting the principle of shared but differentiated responsibilities and calling on developed countries to implement that. The loss and damage fund must be operationalized and existing tools such as peacebuilding must pay attention to climate change.\n\nLUIS ABINADER, President of the Dominican Republic, warned that according to recently published scientific research, the system regulating temperatures in the Atlantic Ocean is approaching a \"devastating\" inflection point, due to melting Arctic glaciers -- implying that the sea level would rise by one metre in some regions, flooding many coastal cities, as is already happening in the Caribbean. Noting that climate vulnerabilities and food shortages increase the risk of violence -- especially where poverty, hunger and inequality prevail -- he condemned the alarming, unjustifiable use of hunger as a weapon of war. Unfortunately, this atrocious practice spreads across the planet every year. While the Council has debated strong responses to this crime, it must intensify its actions.\n\nHe recalled that according to the World Food Crises Report 2023, some 258 million people faced acute levels of hunger in 58 countries or territories in 2022, and the number of people living with hunger increased by 146 per cent. One of those countries is Haiti, with which the Dominican Republic shares an island. According to the WFP, he noted, almost half of the population -- 5 million people -- suffers from acute food insecurity. This is largely due to violent criminal gangs that deliberately hinder access to humanitarian aid and to climate phenomena that cannot be properly addressed and prevented by Haitian authorities due to terrorist violence and institutional breakdown. Citing the Multinational Security Support Mission in Haiti, an arms and ammunition embargo and a sanctions regime, he stressed that the Council has not acted forcefully enough nor given the mission the robustness that the sanctions regime requires. The international community must not allow this catastrophe to continue one day more.\n\nGIORGOS GERAPETRITIS, Minister for Foreign Affairs of Greece, emphasized the interconnectedness of climate crisis and food security and its spill-over effect, which threaten stability and social cohesion. Citing the example of the Mediterranean Sea, a crossroad of three continents, he pointed to the 1.54\u00b0C rise in sea temperature that has turned the region into \"a climate crisis hotspot\", experiencing wildfires and floods with rising sea levels threatening fisheries. Against this backdrop, Athens will host in April \"Our Ocean Conference\" that will focus on the issues of mitigating global warming, advancing sustainable tourism and reducing microplastics pollution. However, no conference or a single State intervention will bring results, he said, calling for a collective reaction of Governments and peoples of the world to address the complexity and extraterritoriality of these challenges.\n\n\"What we need is a different mindset,\" he stressed, highlighting the World Health Organization (WHO)'s \"OneHealth\" project, which aims to balance and optimize the health of people, animals and the environment through an integrated approach. \"We need this type of new vision of global solidarity and intergenerational sustainability,\" he noted, underscoring ethical and rule-based global governance and fair burden sharing among States. \"We are not owners, but merely caretakers on Earth,\" he added.\n\nSIHASAK PHUANGKETKEOW, Vice Minister for Foreign Affairs of Thailand, stressed that the Security Council should have human security as part of its deliberations to ensure peace and security. Also, strengthened coordination between the Council and other relevant UN bodies is vital. \"Climate change is the defining crisis of our time and will continue to affect our lives in multiple dimensions,\" he observed, adding that it respects no borders and poses an urgent and serious threat to all, especially to least developing countries and small island developing States. Calling for a \"planet-centric\" approach, he underscored that the climate crisis must be addressed under the Framework Convention, which -- together with its Paris Agreement -- remains the cornerstone of global climate governance.\n\nHowever, he emphasized that developing countries need support to enhance their capacity to adapt and become more resilient to the adverse impacts of climate change. Accordingly, he reiterated the call of developing countries, echoed by the Secretary-General, for existing financial commitments to be met by developed countries to deliver $100 billion annually and to double adaptation finance. Multilateralism and international cooperation are the most viable solutions to addressing challenges such as climate change, food insecurity, and conflicts, he said, noting that the Summit of the Future presents an opportunity to reinvigorate the multilateral system.\n\nBJ\u00d8RG SANDKJ\u00c6R, State Secretary of International Development of Norway, speaking also for Denmark, Finland, Estonia, Iceland, Latvia, Lithuania and Sweden, observed that the intertwined crises of climate change, conflict and food insecurity are unfolding at a time of increasing instability and geopolitical tensions. In ongoing conflicts, food is being used as a weapon, she warned, stressing an international obligation not to attack civilians or civilian objects necessary for food production. For the Nordic and Baltic countries, conflict prevention must be front and centre of upholding peace and security. \"However, all countries must redouble their efforts to tackle climate change and prevent and resolve conflicts in order to decrease risks of food insecurity,\" she said.\n\nMost important among those measures are, she said, prevention of climate-related conflict and food insecurity by mitigation and adaptation action, as well as strengthening early warning and early action. Further, \"climate-robust agricultural development among small-scale food producers must be scaled up,\" he said, as does climate finance to develop sustainable agriculture. Healthy soil is a prerequisite to fight hunger and strengthen national and global security, she said, adding that seeds and fertilizer must reach those small-scale farmers. Women's full, equal and meaningful participation in all peacebuilding efforts, as well as in climate mitigation and resilience-building, is also essential to comprehensive security efforts, she emphasized.\n\nThe representative of Jamaica, speaking for the Caribbean Community (CARICOM), said small island developing States are deeply aware of the complex interlinkages between frequent extreme weather events and food insecurity. Security-centric measures have failed to address the root causes of crises, he said, adding that, in fact, this approach has, at times, undermined livelihoods and damaged the social contract, as for instance in Lake Chad. Turning to his region, he said Haiti represents a prime example of the vicious nexus between climate change, food insecurity and conflict. The multidimensional crisis in that country has resulted in one of the highest levels of food insecurity in the world, he said, cautioning that this creates a feedback loop as \"there can be no peace among those who are hungry\". Calling for community-centered approaches to environmental management, he said the mandates of all relevant peacekeeping and special political missions must consider climate change and food insecurity.\n\nIn his national capacity, he added that climate change and food insecurity disproportionately affect developing countries as well as women and children in rural areas. The displacement and involuntary migration of populations during climatic events contributes to competition over natural resources. Efforts to address climate change and food insecurity are at the forefront of Jamaica's sustainable development and survival. Highlighting national efforts to improve agricultural productivity, he said these were developed in response to the grave food insecurity threats experienced by the region during the pandemic, during which approximately 2.8 to 3.7 million persons in the English-speaking Caribbean were estimated to be food insecure from 2021 to 2023. Investing in climate adaptation and mitigation measures is an opportunity to strengthen cooperation, build trust and foster social cohesion. Emphasizing the importance of strategic partnerships, he said the alarming status of global hunger calls for swift and practical interventions.\n\nThe representative of Egypt stressed the importance of addressing the challenges facing States affected by and emerging from conflict -- while paying the same attention to the needs of net food-importing developing countries. He cited United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD) estimates that annual climate adaptation costs in developing countries could reach $300 billion in 2030, while implementing their nationally determined contributions will cost around $5.6 trillion. Hence, concessional finance must be given absolute priority. He emphasized that Egypt is the most densely populated water-scarce country in the world, while water scarcity affects 2.5 billion people around the globe, and climate change may put half of the world's population under severe water stress in 2050. He urged the international community to address the needs of the most vulnerable countries and promote transboundary cooperation in accordance with applicable international law to preserve water for life, agriculture, peace and security.\n\nThe representative of Ukraine said that climate change and food security should remain under the purview of the Council given their relevance to maintaining peace and security. Irrespective of the region, food insecurity is accelerated by climate change and can compound conflict situations globally, she observed, underlining the need \"to strengthen multilateralism to promote the interlinkages between climate, peace and security\". In recent years, Ukraine has significantly supported global food security, establishing alternative routes for civilian vessels to and from Black Sea ports. This effort resulted in transporting around 22 million tons of cargo to more than 30 countries, with 70 per cent of this cargo being Ukrainian agricultural products. An end to Russian occupation would increase the supply of Ukrainian food to the global market, she said, deploring the \"aggressive behaviour of the Russian Federation\" that has multiplied conflicts and hindered efforts to tackle global threats like climate change and food insecurity.\n\nThe representative of Jordan said food insecurity, water scarcity, climate change, pollution and desertification aggravate societal tensions and fuel internal conflict. This, in turn, contributes significantly to the weakening of State institutions and the spread of terrorist groups. Calling on the Council to identify targeted measures to maintain international peace and security, he cited conflict, food insecurity and climate disasters as \"main drivers\" of displacement, especially in the Middle East. In Jordan, one third of the population are refugees, he said, adding that his country does its utmost to secure a dignified life for them, despite unprecedented levels of needs. Climate change -- one of the most serious challenges in the Middle East -- threatens regional food security. He further stressed that, since 7 October, Israel has been besieging and starving the people of Gaza -- as a result, the threat of famine has become imminent. Relatedly, the halting of UNRWA's operations in Gaza will increase the risk of famine, he warned, calling on States that suspended their contributions to the Agency to resume their funding.\n\nThe representative of Singapore noted that climate change has reduced global agricultural productivity by 21 per cent since 1961. Today, global food insecurity is reaching catastrophic levels, with over 780 million people -- about 10 per cent of the world's population -- facing hunger. Drawing attention to poor and vulnerable countries, including small island developing States often at the front line of climate change, he stressed the urgency with which to tackle the scourge. The window of opportunity to do so is closing quickly, and it is imperative to uphold a rules-based multilateral trading system and ensure unimpeded movement of essential items such as food and agricultural commodities. \"We must never politicize or weaponize food security,\" he said, urging an end to the vicious cycle of conflict and hunger. Enhancing global capacities in agricultural technology, urban food production and future foods will be also essential to increasing resilience. Singapore is exploring climatic-controlled vertical farming to address the food production challenges facing land-scarce nations.\n\nThe representative of Portugal, aligning herself with the European Union and the Group of Friends on Climate and Security, highlighted Council resolution 2417 (2018) which considers the link between armed conflict, conflict-induced food insecurity and the threat of famine. However, \"we keep witnessing situations in different conflict settings where food is being weaponized against civilians\", she said, calling for immediate humanitarian measures to support local populations in Gaza and Sudan. Alongside these short-term solutions, the international community must also invest in longer-term strategies, such as the transformation of food systems to build resilience. These require the involvement of local communities and the establishment of partnerships with regional organizations. Highlighting the need for concrete steps towards resilience and peacebuilding, she said Portugal recently signed agreements with Cabo Verde and Sao Tome and Principe, both small island developing States, to convert debt into climate investment. Encouraging the Council to continue mandating peacekeeping operations and missions to assess climate-related security risks, she also emphasized the role of the Climate Security Mechanism.\n\nThe representative of Canada, speaking on behalf of the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti of the Economic and Social Council, noted that Haiti is unfortunately a clear example of the interlinkages of climate shocks, food insecurity and institutional fragility, as it continues to grapple with a complex, multidimensional and extremely serious crisis. He recalled a young woman living in Cit\u00e9 Soleil asking why it is easier there for a young person to get a gun than food. Food insecurity in Haiti remains anchored in deep-rooted structural problems, international trade policies, developmental deficits and low harvests caused by climate shocks: 5.5 million people, nearly half the population, require humanitarian assistance and protection, with over 310,000 people internally displaced and others risking their lives to flee one of the most disaster-prone countries in the world. He warned that gang violence is disrupting access to local food and the safe movement of people and goods, including agricultural products.\n\nHe stressed the need to intensify support for Haiti's 2024 Humanitarian Response Plan. The country also needs investment and financing to promote sustainable and climate-smart agricultural practices; develop agricultural value chains that link farmers to markets; and strengthen agrifood systems' resilience to climate, agronomic, economic and conflict shocks. It is also critical to support and advocate for preparedness, disaster risk reduction and climate adaptation measures to increase Haiti's resilience. He further called for urgent assistance to restore security, including through the Multinational Security Support mission. At the same time, Haiti needs help in strengthening security institutions and judicial and correctional systems. A sustainable long-term strategy, led and owned by Haiti, must address the drivers of violence, such as political and social inequalities, extreme poverty, high unemployment, human rights violations, impunity, corruption and weak public institutions. Speaking in his national capacity, he aligned himself with the statement to come by the Group of Friends on Climate and Security.\n\nThe representative of Morocco said that unprecedented food insecurity crises, armed conflicts and climate change \"put resilience and stability of countries around the world to the test\". Addressing these issues is not only a moral imperative but also crucial for international security. The root causes of food insecurity and its consequences need to be tackled through multilateral efforts, he stressed, urging the Council to focus on understanding the links between crises and security factors such as climate change, poverty and inequality, which are often neglected. The international community must address food insecurity with targeted financing for adaptation and climate resilience, he said, detailing his country's efforts to revitalize cooperation for food security, particularly amongst African countries. Against this backdrop, he called for urgent actions \"to strengthen multilateralism and international cooperation to prevent growing hunger around the world and its underlying factors\".\n\nThe representative of Mexico, associating himself with the Group of Friends on Climate and Security, the Group of Friends of Action on Conflict and Hunger, and the Ad Hoc Advisory Group on Haiti, said: \"The reality of global warming means that we are already waist-deep in anticipated problems.\" Recognizing the connection between armed conflict and food insecurity, he observed that rising global temperatures and sea levels have led to more draughts, floods, cyclones and fires. The 2023 El Ni\u00f1o phenomenon brought unprecedented features that are further exacerbating the climate crisis. Also, food systems are being put under strain by climate change, while extreme climate events are causing hunger at a global level. Climate change and food insecurity exacerbate conflict and drive mass displacement. The intersection of climate change and food insecurity is being felt above all by communities that are already experiencing conflict, he pointed out.\n\nThe representative of Syria said that the impacts of climate change go beyond national borders and lead to waves of immigration. This requires a collective response. February marks the first anniversary of the destructive earthquake experienced by his country. The quake claimed thousands of lives and destroyed buildings and infrastructure. The unilateral coercive measures imposed by the United States and the European Union against his country have hindered humanitarian and relief efforts, he said, calling for the lifting of such measures. Syria is also experiencing a decrease in rainfalls, an increase in droughts, desertification and dust storms. This has hurt the lives of Syrians and their ability to meet their basic needs, including water and food. The ongoing Israeli occupation of Arab lands, including the Golan, has also harmed the environment as the occupying Power cut down fruit trees and burned forests.\n\nThe representative of South Africa, noting that famine is increasingly a harsh reality in Palestine, Sudan and Yemen, said the military escalation in Rafah is perpetuating the displacement of Palestinians and threatening civilians' almost non-existent livelihoods. The Council continues to witness the devastating effects of armed conflict on civilians, including the deliberate denial of access to humanitarian relief, he said, condemning the use of hunger and starvation as tactics of war. Despite not being responsible for causing climate change, Africa is particularly vulnerable to its impact, he noted. Expressing solidarity with other regions similarly affected, he said climate change is a global sustainable development challenge that can only be addressed collectively, through a rules-based multilateral regime centered on the 2030 Agenda and the Framework Convention. Underscoring the importance of equity, he said support for developing countries' climate action needs to be dramatically scaled up.\n\nThe representative of the Czech Republic, aligning himself with the European Union and the Group of Friends on Climate and Security, cited the FAO's recent report The State of Food Security and Nutrition in the World 2023, which finds that between 691 million and 783 million people in the world faced hunger in 2022. He noted that the global food crisis is exacerbated by armed conflicts like the Russian Federation's war of aggression against Ukraine, climate change, and the impacts of the COVID-19 pandemic. In collaboration with the WFP and other partners, the Czech Republic has promoted community resilience building in conflict- and climate-threatened areas. He championed implementation of the Secretary-General\u00b4s \"Early Warnings for All\" initiative -- to help ensure that everyone on the planet is protected from hazardous weather, water, or climate events by the end of 2027. To achieve the Paris Agreement's goals, \"we must transform agriculture and food systems to be more conflict-sensitive and gender-responsive,\" he stressed.\n\nThe representative of Indonesia expressed concern about the ability of the Council to act in order to address the interlinkages between climate change, food insecurity and peace and security. Citing the situation in Gaza, where \"hunger and food insecurity is used as a despicable weapon\", he called for progress in transforming the Council through reform as well as improving its working methods and ethics. Likewise, peacekeeping operations should be equipped with a more tailored mandate and adequate resources to assist local communities in adapting to security impacts of climate change and food insecurity. Stronger partnership with regional organizations in addressing the climate, food and peace and security nexus is important for connecting with national experiences and accelerating responses. Further, it is imperative to strengthen the role of the Peacebuilding Commission and ensure synergy within the United Nations system. \"Ability to connect the dots is key in addressing such an interlinked issue,\" he added.\n\nThe representative of Belgium, speaking also on behalf of the Netherlands and Luxembourg, said that climate change exacerbates existing social, political, economic, environmental and gender-specific drivers of conflict. It impacts food security through less predictable weather patterns and higher temperatures. This leads to lower productivity and food quality and can contribute to conflicts over scarce water and land. The climate-food insecurity-conflict nexus works the other way as well: conflicts exacerbate food insecurity, like in the Sahel region and especially in Sudan. \"We need to act now, and we need to act better,\" he asserted, outlining solution-oriented elements that should allow both for peace-positive climate action and addressing conflict-induced food insecurity.\n\nHe expressed hope that consensus will be reached on the suggestions presented in the Secretary-General's policy brief on a \"New Agenda for Peace\". Recognizing climate, peace and security as a political priority, he stressed that climate action and peacebuilding reinforce each other. Also, it is critical to collectively support the Climate Security Mechanism and its development. Emphasizing the impact of food systems on climate change, he said that adapting them is part of the solution to the climate and food crises. He further called for a renewed commitment to the implementation of resolution 2417 (2018), which bars using hunger and starvation as weapons of war.\n\nThe representative of Liechtenstein said that sea-level rise is one of the most dramatic effects of the rapid rise in global emissions. Highlighting injustice, he said that people living in the most affected countries are the lowest contributors to CO2 emissions. The unprecedented scenario of full or partial inundation of the territory of a State, or the relocation of its people, should not change the general presumption in international law that only the concerned people should be able to make decisions on how to exercise their right to self-determination, including through Statehood. Liechtenstein is finalizing its process to seek an advisory opinion from the International Court of Justice regarding climate change and international law.\n\nThe representative of Poland said the \"convening power and leadership\" of the United Nations is essential to respond to the global food crisis, climate change and their correlation to peace and security. Food security is a priority theme for his country, he said, noting that it is a newly elected member of the Economic and Social Council and the Peacebuilding Commission. The relationship between climate change and conflict should be explored and properly addressed in a systemic way by the Security Council. It is regrettable that a few countries continue to block consensus on this matter, he said, condemning the starvation of civilians as a method of war. Further, Governments and international organizations should continue to strengthen food systems so they can better withstand extreme weather events and climate variability. Highlighting his country's support for WFP and FAO, he said the question of climate and security should be included in the regular work of the Security Council.\n\nThe representative of Guatemala noted that her country is located in one of the regions most exposed to the impacts of the existential threat of climate change that, to a large extent, has been caused by other nations -- calling on them to assume their responsibilities. It is urgent to address climate change and food insecurity, remembering that they are dangerous risk multipliers, aggravating humanitarian crises and exacerbating conflict, especially in fragile situations where Governments have limited means to help their populations adapt. Calling for continued work on the Secretary-General's \"Early Warnings for All\" initiative to ensure its full implementation, she also voiced support for the Peacebuilding Commission and the incorporation of environmental action in its activities. She further emphasized the importance of the full operationalization and financing of the loss and damage fund and to continue increasing ambition for climate funding at the 2024 United Nations Climate Change Conference.\n\nThe representative of Chile, describing climate change as \"a threat multiplier\", warned that in combination with socioeconomic or geopolitical factors it can worsen the risk of violence and intensify conflicts, destabilize food systems and generate food insecurity. Highlighting the consequences of climate change, including sea-level rise, biodiversity loss, air pollution and deforestation, he called on States to protect the right to food for their citizens and strengthen national food systems. For this reason, it is fundamental to boost cooperation between States, especially in conflict-affected areas where food insecurity is prevalent. Among other solutions, he pointed to the energy transition, urging the international community to increase innovation, share successful experiences and boost production of essential foodstuffs for national and local consumption in areas sensitive to climate change. Increased climate financing to address the consequences of global warming is essential, he underscored, while deploring market closures and unilateral coercive measures that run counter to reducing hunger.\n\nThe representative of Bulgaria said that strengthening the operationalization of Council resolution 2417 (2018) and the regular submission of white papers on conflict and hunger can enable the organ to ensure that food production and distribution are protected in times of conflict and that civilian populations can safely access life- and livelihood-saving assistance. She warned that the vicious cycle of climate change, conflict and hunger will only intensify unless the Council takes climate change as a priority. Greater global efforts by all stakeholders are needed to address the challenges associated with food insecurity and climate change and their relation to conflicts with a special focus on the coordinated implementation of SDG2 on hunger, SDG13 on climate action, and SDG16 on peace and strong institutions.\n\nThe representative of the Philippines said his country is \"a living testament to the harsh realities of climate change\". Devastating typhoons, rising sea levels and the perilous threats they pose to biodiversity, ecosystems and livelihoods have compelled the country to take bold and decisive actions. The World Risk Index 2023 ranked the Philippines first for disaster risk and fourth for exposure. In response, his country adopted a national climate change action plan which prioritizes food security, water sufficiency and ecological and environmental stability. Highlighting the peace process in Bangsamoro Autonomous Region in Muslim Mindanao, he said his Government has instituted socioeconomic programmes to address the needs of internally displaced persons and poverty stricken communities. Acknowledging the value of FAO as a science- and evidence-based knowledge organization, he stressed the need for openness and multilateralism in the trade of food and agricultural products and to ensure targeted humanitarian action.\n\nThe representative of Italy, aligning himself with the European Union and the Group of Friends on Climate and Security, called on the Council to swiftly address the many unacceptable cases of \"weaponization of food security\" and all Member States to take responsible action. Commending the key role played by the Black Sea Grain Initiative, he expressed deep regret over its unilateral termination by the Russian Federation. Italy fully supports the alternative routes, such as the European Union Solidarity Lanes, that are facilitating the export of food to the rest of the world, particularly in Africa. He recalled that, in 2023, his Government hosted the momentous UN Food Systems Summit+2 in Rome, where the Secretary-General launched his Call to Action, addressing the interlinkages between food insecurity and other global crises. Italy is also making food security a key priority of its Group of 7 presidency.\n\nThe representative of Spain, aligning herself with the European Union and the Group of Friends of the Family, recognized the existence of interlinkages between climate change, food insecurity and conflicts, which is reflected in her country's humanitarian diplomacy strategy for 2023. This strategy advocates for including climate considerations in early warning mechanisms. Calling for peace and security mission mandates to incorporate a climate approach, she stressed the need for the Council's work on conflict prevention to include \"climate risk analysis and food insecurity analysis, as these are risk multipliers and drivers of conflict\". She went on to demand more concrete and tangible action, such as the appointment of a special envoy for climate, peace and security, while emphasizing the Council's responsibility to address the consequences of climate change on food production, which is particularly affecting small- and medium-sized producers and tenant farmers globally.\n\nThe representative of Pakistan said that addressing the looming water crisis will be critical. Increased water demand, coupled with climate change impacts, creates the potential for transboundary water disputes in several parts of the world. His country attaches high priority to the strict implementation of the Indus Waters Treaty and aims to reinvigorate the Indus river basin -- the largest contiguous irrigation system in the world, which provides food security to over 225 million people. When addressing climate change, \"securitizing\" the issue in the development agenda must be avoided. The already scarce funding should not be diverted from development and climate change actions to security-related approaches. \"Scarcity is the mother of most conflicts,\" he said, adding that \"the best means of conflict prevention is sustainable development, achieving the SDGs and the climate goals\". The Security Council could make a singular contribution to both climate and development goals by endorsing the commitments made on those issues and transforming them into binding obligations.",
